For the record, I&rsquo;m not pretending to be super knowledgeable about this, but I have been following it on and off.</p><iframe width=560 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/tigaryz-1y4 frameborder=0 allowfullscreen></iframe><p>One of the more interesting comments he makes during the video is how for the past ten years the Greek government has been mis-reporting their financial situation. And when a new party would take over, they would make a really big fuss about how the previous administration was lying, only to continue the cycle themselves. (Remember &ndash; just going off the video &ndash; I haven&rsquo;t researched this too much).</p><p>It is worth thinking a little about the role of [lack of] government transparency in this situation. This may or not be related, and may not be the core of the problem at all, but I&rsquo;m willing to posit that it was a factor.</p><p>If it was the responsibility of the Greek Government to report all the numbers to the public fully, in terms of their budgeting, dept and deficit, I can&rsquo;t help but wonder if this situation could&rsquo;ve been avoided. I&rsquo;m guessing the Greek Gov would continually report aggregated statistics with no way to reproduce the results. In my opinion, the farther you get get from the raw data, the more room there is for mistakes and manipulation &ndash; malicious or not.</p><p>However, I&rsquo;ll also point out that government transparency is only half the game. The other part would&rsquo;ve been on citizens, reporters, watchdog groups and other EU members to take this data, analyze it <strong><em>independently</em></strong> and provide the analysis in a reproducible format. This way it&rsquo;s not just data without the insights, but rather something actionable.</p><p>Just thoughts and a rant. I read the Economist and I watch the news, but I&rsquo;m no expert so don&rsquo;t listen to me.</p><p>On a much lighter note, (at least as light as the Greek financial situation can be) here&rsquo;s another great video about the crisis, but this time with some rapping involved:</p><iframe width=560 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ObpSd9DVD9E frameborder=0 allowfullscreen></iframe><p><br></p><a href="/greek_crisis/">Read more &raquo;</a></div><div class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href="/pdf_extraction_tabula/">Quick and Dirty PDF Table Extraction</a></h1><span class=post-date>10 Oct 2014</span><p>Recently, I had to do a quick, dirty and un-automated extraction of some table data from PDF. I need to take a single table out of a financial statement and extract it to CSV.</p><p>While you can find plenty of tutorials on how to automate this process, I didn&rsquo;t really find a whole lot on doing it just once for a specific PDF.

I spent the first ten years of my life in a country much different than this one, with a much different culture. After arriving in the United States, I witnessed and participated in my family’s struggle to understand and work with the complex bureaucracies wrapped around immigration, food stamps, social security and public services. I waited with my family in seemingly endless lines, only to be told I needed to go to a different building and wait in another endless line. I learned that the system is flawed and wondered how to fix it.</p><p>I have always been curious in understanding how cities develop, sustain and function, and I have been fortunate enough to explore these topics in many cities and countries across the globe. Just like every human being, every city&ndash;while maintaining similarity in the most obvious and general features&ndash;is an extremely unique and complicated living organism.</p><p>And just like when doctors treat human beings, often unsure that the decision or action they’re taking will help rather than harm the patient, oftentimes the people making decisions for a city simply do not have the information to be confident in the outcome of their actions.</p><p>I have always been the observer. I always wondered, read, asked, but never acted. I saw, but never dove deep enough to understand. I often wondered how my skills could be of help, but was never really able to answer the question on my own.</p><p>Today we have the technology and the knowledge to help governments make better decisions, provide better services to their residents, and to improve the quality of numerous people’s lives.</p><p>That’s why I’m coding for America. As a Code For America fellow, I have an opportunity to no longer be the observer, but the doer. I have a chance to dive in deep and use my skills to help fix and improve the systems that each of us interacts with on a daily basis.</p><a href="/why_im_coding_for_america/">Read more &raquo;</a></div></div><div class=pagination><a class="pagination-item older" href=/page2>Older</a> <span class="pagination-item newer">Newer</span></div></div></div><label for=sidebar-checkbox class=sidebar-toggle></label></body></html>
