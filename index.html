We went through an overview of the process of my getting hired at the city of San Diego, which was an interesting process indeed.</p><p>You can catch the video here:</p><iframe width=560 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/6BGw2Msv2Wg frameborder=0 allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Some of the key points we tried to hit:</p><h3>Go to the Candidate</h3><p>The candidates government are often looking for tend to not go trolling around for jobs on government websites. Find them where they already hang out &ndash; StackOverflow, Meetup Groups, Mailing lists.</p><h3>Involve the Private Sector</h3><p>Private sector participation lends credibility to our process, ensures community buy-in, and helps governments evaluate a candidate’s compatibility in both the public and the private sector.</p><h3>Communicate the Challenge</h3><p>Working in a startup with a 100 people is very different than working in an organization of 11,000. Being responsible to a few shareholders is very different than having to answer to a few million taxpayers. Cities need to be better at communicating the challenge inherent in this type of scale to applicants. Taking on these types of challenges is a once in a lifetime opportunity.</p><h3>Be Agile</h3><p>For government to be competitive in attracting technologists it must be innovative, flexible, and make decisions quickly.</p><h3>Show Humanity</h3><p>When I found out I was going to interview with the Mayor, wasn’t sure whether I should take off the piercings. A thought process involving a wise Russian, a loud Argentinian and several Coronas, I decided that I needed to get hired as myself.</p><p>As I walked into the Mayor’s conference room we all sat down. He asked me if I wanted a cup of coffee. Like an idiot I said yes, so the Mayor got up and made me a cup of coffee.</p><p>During the interview a question prompted me to open my laptop, and I did, not giving a thought to the plethora of stickers I had on the lid, including a middle finger sticker. So my laptop proceeds to flip off the Mayor.</p><p>A culture where the Mayor gives the go ahead to hire the pierced guy whose laptop flipped him off ripples through all ranks of the organization. If cities have a culture anywhere near as awesome as the City of San Diego does today, they should put that front and center in the hiring process.</p><h3>Support and Mentoring</h3><p>Governments need match the technological skills you’re bringing with mentorship and support.</p><p>Overall, I definitely enjoyed preparing and doing the talk which seemed to hit a lot of points for people.</p><p>The conference overall was an amazing experience. It was such a pleasure seeing everyone I&rsquo;ve worked with and interacted with over the years.</p><p>One of my coworkers that came to the conference with us had never been to a conference before. Ever. This was amazing to me. I&rsquo;m so glad that the CfA Summit was her first one. The warm atmosphere and the awesome community definitely gave her a great welcome and she had a blast.</p><a href="/cfa_summit_pres/">Read more &raquo;</a></div><div class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href="/greek_crisis/">The Greek Financial Crisis</a></h1><span class=post-date>18 Jul 2015</span><p>These are some of my favorite YouTube video producers, and they recently just made a really great explainer about the Greek crisis and how the situation got to be so bad. For the record, I&rsquo;m not pretending to be super knowledgeable about this, but I have been following it on and off.</p><iframe width=560 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/tigaryz-1y4 frameborder=0 allowfullscreen></iframe><p>One of the more interesting comments he makes during the video is how for the past ten years the Greek government has been mis-reporting their financial situation. And when a new party would take over, they would make a really big fuss about how the previous administration was lying, only to continue the cycle themselves. (Remember &ndash; just going off the video &ndash; I haven&rsquo;t researched this too much).</p><p>It is worth thinking a little about the role of [lack of] government transparency in this situation. This may or not be related, and may not be the core of the problem at all, but I&rsquo;m willing to posit that it was a factor.</p><p>If it was the responsibility of the Greek Government to report all the numbers related to budgeting, debt, and deficit to the public fully and in a machine readable format, I can&rsquo;t help but wonder if this situation could&rsquo;ve been avoided, or at least lessened. I&rsquo;m guessing the Greek Government would continually report aggregated statistics with no way to reproduce the results. The further you get from the raw data, the more room there is for mistakes and manipulation &ndash; malicious or not.</p><p>However, I&rsquo;ll also point out that government transparency is only half the game. The other part would&rsquo;ve been on citizens, reporters, watchdog groups and other EU members to take this data, analyze it <strong><em>independently</em></strong> and provide the analysis in a reproducible format. This way it&rsquo;s not just data without the insights, but rather something actionable, credible and reproducible.</p><p>Just thoughts and a rant. I read the Economist and I watch the news, but I&rsquo;m no expert so don&rsquo;t listen to me.</p><p>On a much lighter note, (at least as light as the Greek financial situation can be) here&rsquo;s another great video about the crisis, but this time with some rapping involved:</p><iframe width=560 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ObpSd9DVD9E frameborder=0 allowfullscreen></iframe><p><br></p><a href="/greek_crisis/">Read more &raquo;</a></div><div class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href="/pdf_extraction_tabula/">Quick and Dirty PDF Table Extraction</a></h1><span class=post-date>10 Oct 2014</span><p>Recently, I had to do a quick, dirty and un-automated extraction of some table data from PDF. I need to take a single table out of a financial statement and extract it to CSV.</p><p>While you can find plenty of tutorials on how to automate this process, I didn&rsquo;t really find a whole lot on doing it just once for a specific PDF.
