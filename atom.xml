   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mrm-screen.s3.amazonaws.com/JK6HW3Ka-lFo1s3CiBB9MemZYO7Oi1wUAlDb4iKf32Q.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Maksim Council&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fairly recently, I celebrated my 1 year anniversary of being with the city of San Diego as the Chief Data Officer. Naturally, I’ve been reflecting on my first year in government, and one of the things that strikes me the most is the amount of things that I learned. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some things I learned on my own &amp;ndash; in many cases I invested in supplementary learning in order to succeed.  Others I can directly attribute to conversations with my boss, Almis, my teammates in &lt;a href=&quot;http://sandiego.gov/pad&quot;&gt;Performance and Analytics&lt;/a&gt;, the City’s IT staff, and so many others that if I list them all, this would be a spreadsheet, not a blog post. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be completely honest &amp;ndash; I had my hesitations about taking a local government job.  I was worried I wouldn’t advance my technological skill, and potentially lose many of the marketable skills I possess.  However, looking back on this year, taking a government job has proven to be one of the smartest and challenging things I’ve ever done.  There is no other place I can think of that would push me so far out of my comfort zone, in so many different directions, while providing me the help and support to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Technical Skills&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mrm-screen.s3.amazonaws.com/FkfrZF40zVTufzhDi4YTumNGu6LEAPRoMSllrUPmNyU.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tools&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tools for the Job.&lt;/strong&gt; I’m proud to say that I have a very wide expertise in a diverse range of technologies, languages and stacks.  I walked into this job with a preconception that my large toolbox can solve a variety of problems quickly.  Instead, I quickly realized that in order to use my toolbox effectively, I needed to understand all the intricate non-technological complexities such as strategy, culture, processes, and even words used to describe things.  What&amp;rsquo;s more, I had to expand my toolbox with more open source and not-so-open-source tools.  The City is a large enterprise, and not everything can be solved by cloning a repo or a $30 a month subscription. This intangible skill of understanding City operations and figuring out the details of how to apply the correct technology has been one of my biggest learnings this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R Language.&lt;/strong&gt; This past year, I learned the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.r-project.org/&quot;&gt;R language&lt;/a&gt; - the first data-focused language I’ve used. In addition to learning the language itself, I learned how to communicate research and data analysis through detailed and reproducible reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Apps Script.&lt;/strong&gt; I wouldn’t necessarily say that I &amp;ldquo;learned&amp;rdquo; it, but I definitely became much more familiar with the capacities of Apps Script for handling large amounts of documents programmatically.  This code ran a lot of our initial data inventory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GIS.&lt;/strong&gt; Through our wonderful GIS manager, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arcgis.com/features/&quot;&gt;ArcGIS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cartodb.com/&quot;&gt;CartoDB&lt;/a&gt;, I became much more familiar with GIS operations and concepts. However, I would place myself very far from expert level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://take.ms/ijqAB&quot; alt=&quot;Cyber&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cybersecurity.&lt;/strong&gt; Something we often don’t think about when it comes to cities is the massive need for cybersecurity. Cities are constantly getting hit and need robust and well-managed cybersecurity programs in place. I have become good friends with the CISO and the Cyber team in San Diego and learned quite a bit about their strategies, technologies and methods.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enterprise IT.&lt;/strong&gt; We often like to make fun of &amp;ldquo;antiquated&amp;rdquo; City technology like SAP and Oracle. However, these are still massive companies running multi-million dollar projects and are not going away soon. I’ve worked quite a bit with IT to understand the ecosystems and infrastructure that manage these large datastores within the City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So Many Datastores.&lt;/strong&gt; This brings me to the diversity of datastores within the City. From a technical level, I’ve been exposed to a variety of SAP, Oracle, Microsoft and ESRI products. This year, I’ve had lots of technology land on my plate. Even though this isn’t very sexy, going down the journey of learning these technologies has been a blast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Networks.&lt;/strong&gt; Working with IT to understand the City’s networks, I’ve learned a ton about the City’s DNS architecture, networks, configuration management, desktop management, Active Directory and so much more.  The City also does a lot of cool things, such as producing its own TV station.  We even have a truck that can pull up to a location and provide wi-fi and cellular communications in emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Strategic Skills&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technological Interventions.&lt;/strong&gt; Operational improvement opportunities that would otherwise remain hidden often surface when a public-facing data visualization or analysis is on the horizon. It’s a fortunate thing I work in a department that cares to fix those as well.  I have also begun to explore how to use what I call &amp;ldquo;technological interventions&amp;rdquo; strategically to discover problems in processes of collecting, generating and sharing data across systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communicating with Executives.&lt;/strong&gt; In the course of my work, I had to learn how to work with elected officials and high level executives. I learned how to properly scale the level of detail while explaining complex technical concepts and challenges. Scaling detail is extremely important because it’s often necessary for me to walk a fine line between confusing the person I’m talking to and providing them with the amount of information necessary for them to make a decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://take.ms/kN0t2&quot; alt=&quot;Boss&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing up&lt;/strong&gt; became very important as well. My boss is extremely flexible and understanding, but oftentimes he doesn’t need to (or really want to) be deeply involved in the details of my decision making and thought processes: he empowers me, which is both scary and great.  It makes sense too: he really doesn’t need to know all the variables I’m weighing when deciding on a technology or working on a project.  By managing up, I’m able to keep his expectations at the proper levels while giving myself a good amount of flexibility to change my mind.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing Meetings.&lt;/strong&gt; Government is notorious for having a meeting-loving culture. I learned how to manage and limit the amount of meetings that I end up involved with, while making sure that I maintain relationships and remain apprised of what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluating technology&lt;/strong&gt; in the context of the City, or rather in the context of enterprise IT requires weighing many factors.  I learned a lot about how to evaluate technological solutions in this type of context.  How does a piece of software fit into the larger IT roadmap?  What do the service level agreements and maintenance options look like?  Is it better to get Open Source or proprietary solutions?  How will this impact the City’s cybersecurity risk exposure?  What is the price point and what are the related procurement rules dictating the process we’ll go through?  All these factors weigh into evaluating a piece of software in a large IT environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hacking People, no USB cable required&lt;/strong&gt;.  No, really, I learned how to get 65 non-technical people who have other jobs to answer my questions about what data they have, make it extremely easy for them to do so, and not have them hate you afterwards.  Oh, and only have one large meeting through that whole process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shipping.&lt;/strong&gt; I learned quite a bit about how to balance the inherent complexity of being a CDO of a massive organization with designing the correct architecture, building a sustainable infrastructure, and well, shipping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Shipping.&lt;/strong&gt; Elaborating on the point above, I tend to lean more on the perfectionist side of being a programmer.  I’ll think deeply about choosing the right framework, picking the right stack and overall making sure I’m doing things &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo;.  In the past, this caused unnecessary slowdowns in some of my projects.  However, in this past year, when I had a much smaller part of my time to be a developer, I noticed myself being able to adjust my “perfectionist” strategies towards a strategy where I just write some code, and refactor if I’m going to keep it.  It seems like a minor shift, but being able to accept imperfection in my own code has allowed me to prototype a lot more, a lot faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technology Perception Gaps.&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve learned to see and more clearly understand the gap between the public’s perception of Open Data and the technology and effort needed to deliver data that isn’t just open, but is accurate and complete.  While this gap exists in the Open Data space, I would argue that this gap exists in many perceptions that the public has about City IT.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning from Private Sector.&lt;/strong&gt; I often seek out sources of inspiration for my work by attending private sector events, training sessions, and simply communicating with technology communities that I’m used to working with. I also love to interact with other governments to see how they’re doing things. However, not everything that works in the private sector works in the government space. I learned quite a bit about how to learn (and not learn) from the private sector and relate it to our work at the City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Data Activation Points.&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve begun to see &amp;ldquo;Activation Points&amp;rdquo; for open data – where opening data ties in smooth as butter with a current City initiative. (Sustainability, Performance Management, Public Records Act Requests (PRA)).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building and running a data team&lt;/strong&gt; is a leadership, strategic and tactical challenge.  I have learned, and am still learning a lot about how to build one, ramp it up, and align the correct pieces for delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Departments / City Operations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mrm-screen.s3.amazonaws.com/CDzAoLRdhebNHFZ8wzpFfVS4WQHoGXNHwd3mwCq4ZRg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;LifeGuard&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifeguards.&lt;/strong&gt; I learned a ton about what lifeguards do, how they operate, and some of the technological challenges of the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Police.&lt;/strong&gt; I explored how the City’s Police Department works with bar owners in the Gaslamp to create a safer area, handle barbreak (when all the bars let out) and prevent crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mrm-screen.s3.amazonaws.com/blGfuh6Z8Li39Vgz78R0GeNf69cEAlFB3ddcR1XoOSY.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;BarBreak&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Street Work.&lt;/strong&gt; I know much more about how the City’s street work gets done, and the different types of repair jobs.  I was also surprised to find out that the City does a proactive job of making sure that money isn’t wasted by having the same street repaved multiple times in a short period.  Because of various responsibilities different departments have when it comes to digging up a street, they do a lot of work to coordinate the timing of the construction.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRAs.&lt;/strong&gt; Many people outside of government or journalism don’t even know about PRAs.  Working with the City’s PRA coordinator, I’ve learned a ton about the legalities of the process and how they work within the City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emergency Response.&lt;/strong&gt; Do you know what to do if an earthquake hits? Your City officials do - they often conduct training and simulations for different disaster scenarios.  I got to explore this as well. They have a &amp;ldquo;situation room&amp;rdquo; in one of the buildings, stocked with food and computers. Learning about the City’s ways of managing disaster has been nothing short of amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mrm-screen.s3.amazonaws.com/n7fTr2uXzd7lHJZDRClDslP2Pqgv5l7Jc9mxPkwgykU.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Crap&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crap.&lt;/strong&gt; I learned all about what happens to the crap we flush. It’s actually way more interesting than it sounds. This is a story that encompasses poop, energy generation, earplugs, and seals.  Where did I learn about this?  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sandiego.gov/mwwd/facilities/ptloma/&quot;&gt;Point Loma Wastewater Treatment Plant&lt;/a&gt; - an automated plant that serves 2.2 million residents run by only 50 people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Communications and Community&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talking Louder.&lt;/strong&gt; I have been a quiet and shy speaker for most of my life.  However, when I started this job, I quickly learned (with Almis’ advice) that I needed to overcome that.  I took several months of improv classes (which were a blast) and while I’m still working up to having a booming voice, I can definitely say that I haven’t been asked to speak louder in a long time.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mrm-screen.s3.amazonaws.com/RhYlSZwxJ38x_YJ96g3EvW4ivMzPpFbYuOdf_twbQyY.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Press&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Press.&lt;/strong&gt; I learned a lot about how to talk and work with the press. It was really fascinating to learn the role of press in government and how the City handles communication with journalists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Speaking.&lt;/strong&gt; I still need to tally up how much public speaking I’ve done this year, but it was definitely more than I’ve ever done in my life. There’s plenty of things I learned in this arena this year, such as structuring effective presentations, storytelling, and other skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://take.ms/qrrSK&quot; alt=&quot;Ignite&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ignite Talk.&lt;/strong&gt; I gave an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvABvAM11XM&quot;&gt;Ignite Talk&lt;/a&gt; about the data flowing through a City block.  Obviously, I learned how to give an Ignite talk, which in itself is a very difficult, but ultimately rewarding experience.  But through that process I discovered how much I knew about the data flowing through cities &amp;ndash; and how much I have yet to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reporting to Council.&lt;/strong&gt; I also got to prepare a report to the City council and present it - a learning experience in and of itself. As a side note, as part of getting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://datasd.gitbooks.io/council_report/&quot;&gt;Open Data Implementation Update&lt;/a&gt; ready for council, I ended up making a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook/pull/813&quot;&gt;pull request&lt;/a&gt; to a major open-source software project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community Building.&lt;/strong&gt; I always felt that in order for Open Data to be successful in San Diego, we needed to have a strong Civic Tech community. Before, this was far from the case. Now, we’re much closer – I’ve learned a ton about how to put the right people in the right place to get the community moving. I&amp;rsquo;m very excited about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/opensandiego&quot;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/Open-San-Diego/&quot;&gt;Open San Diego&lt;/a&gt; has accomplished in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mrm-random.s3.amazonaws.com/dz/2015-05-19%2018.03.23.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Meters&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connecting Geeks to Government.&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to building the community, I’ve always strongly felt there was a missing connection between CfA Brigade members, residents, and City employees. Bringing various people in the City-people I greatly respect-to talk about what they do with the brigade has been an invaluable learning experience both for me, the brigade, and the employees. I think we often forget how freaking cool City government can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Surprises&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mrm-screen.s3.amazonaws.com/L3m6_FmcRUPXoQ02fttrdGrayRX_GPPVFY4XZHKmSHs.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Surprises&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passion.&lt;/strong&gt; I was surprised about how I feel after a conversation with a City employee (not everyone of course, but so many of them). For example, I talked to someone about parking meters and was inspired and excited after that conversation. It’s amazing to see people that have just as much passion for their craft as many programmers do for theirs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data geeks.&lt;/strong&gt; I’m not talking &amp;ldquo;analysts&amp;rdquo;. I’m talking about the people that geek out over Excel macros and SQL queries. Or GIS. There aren’t many of them in the City, but they’re there. It takes a while to find them too. But once you do – wow – they can teach you so much and are such a pleasure to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Literacy.&lt;/strong&gt; How people think about what data is, how they define data, how they understand KPIs and metrics has been a challenge that I have enjoyed learning about and solving.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mrm-screen.s3.amazonaws.com/UFqXeLkzS_tU-kcuoIENvcWWKXtVxA4o-eKzR1RkTQs.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Clifton&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Doors.&lt;/strong&gt; Many people already recognize the potential for decreased workload and better communications that opening data carries. I was extremely surprised how many people approached me, excited for their data to be opened up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State of The City.&lt;/strong&gt; Did you know that just like the President does an annual State of the Union, many mayors do a State of the City Address? I didn’t. It was amazing to see it get put together, how many people work on it, and some of the things I learned by attending.  Also it was pretty sweet to get a shout from Mayor Faulconer just a month into the job. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dependencies.&lt;/strong&gt; I noticed a distinct difference between how I’m used to working to how I have to work in the City.  In my previous jobs as a software developer and architect, I could generally forge my own path and minimize a lot of critical reliance on other people.  In the City I feel highly leveraged &amp;ndash; oftentimes the support of others is absolutely critical.  I haven’t thought too far down this path yet, but will be exploring it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mrm-screen.s3.amazonaws.com/G1y5CL8dOxX9UY-xN9VyE0e_ELxvtxgN0VM0NWr-Ly8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Delegation Pres&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internationalizing.&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve had the opportunity to present to Macedonian and Philippine delegations. In the Mayor’s conference room. About Open Data. Nuff said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNAMEs.&lt;/strong&gt; When we were launching OpenGov - our budget tool, I thought it would be great for us to map it to &lt;a href=&quot;http://budget.sandiego.gov&quot;&gt;http://budget.sandiego.gov&lt;/a&gt;.  The saga that happened while I was trying to do something fairly simple &amp;ndash; just map a CNAME to a domain &amp;ndash; was a journey I will never forget.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Random&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vendors.&lt;/strong&gt; Working with vendors has been good, bad and ugly. There is so much to write about here: from evaluating proposals and negotiating; to the &amp;ldquo;classifications&amp;rdquo; of vendors I’ve begun to unofficially define based on what they sell and how they sell it; to how they can have better strategy and products. We have developed numerous ways to streamline the process of vendor pitches by having a standard method and questions that they have to use to get in touch with us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;City Awards and Competitions&lt;/strong&gt;, run by various think tanks and vendors are also something I’ve been reflecting on lately. While having some value, a lot of times they appear to be run more for the benefit of a vendor looking to score more government contracting opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time Management.&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve had to implement rigid time management methodologies because of the amount of noise often coming on my plate. While this may seem like an underwhelming learned lesson, I would say this is what has allowed me to become the most effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project Management.&lt;/strong&gt; When you have an organization of 11,000 people, IT projects quickly start to look a little different. Sometimes there’s a legitimate need for a strong project management methodology. Sometimes there isn’t. I’ve learned quite a bit about how the City runs large IT projects&amp;ndash;and small ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hiring.&lt;/strong&gt; As part of hiring my first employee, I got to be on the hiring side, all the way through the recruitment process. I ended up taking notes for myself, for, you know, the next time I have to look for a job. It was super valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mrm-screen.s3.amazonaws.com/yNAvvjKDqmoQ9kuo6t1zliN2FESeAWh8XHr3y1tIrTA.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sup Academy&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supervising.&lt;/strong&gt; Because I was getting a new employee, I had to go through the City’s &amp;ldquo;Supervisor’s Academy&amp;rdquo;. This was a seven day course, outlining everything from City support for employees experiencing various issues, to ethics, to leadership. I found it extremely useful and learned a ton about, well, being a good supervisor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ethics.&lt;/strong&gt; I learned a bit of how ethics and campaign finance work in the City context, and had some fairly interesting conversations with the Ethics commission, including one about the limits on what expenses can and cannot be covered by a conference organizer who invites me to present at a conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summarizing my experience at the City, the main thing that surprised me this year was how much I was pushed out of my boundaries, and how many things I’ve done that I never thought I could or would do. Everything from learning a new language, doing an Ignite talk, to learning how to be a better communicator and leader, I can attribute to being a City employee in one way or another. Now that year 1 is behind me, I’m stoked for year 2.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>CfA Summit Presentation</title>
   <link href="maksim.io/cfa_summit_pres/"/>
   <updated>2015-10-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>maksim.io/cfa_summit_pres</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the Code For America Summit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of September I got a chance to speak at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codeforamerica.org/summit/&quot;&gt;2015 Code For America Summit&lt;/a&gt; with my boss, Almis Udrys.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had the opportunity to do a lightning talk about the government talent pipeline.  We went through an overview of the process of my getting hired at the city of San Diego, which was an interesting process indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can catch the video here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/6BGw2Msv2Wg&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the key points we tried to hit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Go to the Candidate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The candidates government are often looking for tend to not go trolling around for jobs on government websites.  Find them where they already hang out &amp;ndash; StackOverflow, Meetup Groups, Mailing lists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Involve the Private Sector&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private sector participation lends credibility to our process, ensures community buy-in, and helps governments evaluate a candidate’s compatibility in both the public and the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Communicate the Challenge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working in a startup with a 100 people is very different than working in an organization of 11,000.  Being responsible to a few shareholders is very different than having to answer to a few million taxpayers. Cities need to be better at communicating the challenge inherent in this type of scale to applicants.  Taking on these types of challenges is a once in a lifetime opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Be Agile&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For government to be competitive in attracting technologists it must be innovative, flexible, and make decisions quickly.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Show Humanity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I found out I was going to interview with the Mayor, wasn’t sure whether I should take off the piercings.  A thought process involving a wise Russian, a loud Argentinian  and several Coronas, I decided that I needed to get hired as myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I walked into the Mayor’s conference room we all sat down.  He asked me if I wanted a cup of coffee.  Like an idiot I said yes, so the Mayor got up and made me a cup of coffee.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the interview a question prompted me to open my laptop, and I did, not giving a thought to the plethora of stickers I had on the lid, including a middle finger sticker.  So my laptop proceeds to flip off the Mayor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A culture where the Mayor gives the go ahead to hire the pierced guy whose laptop flipped him off ripples through all ranks of the organization.  If cities have a culture anywhere near as awesome as the City of San Diego does today, they should put that front and center in the hiring process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Support and Mentoring&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Governments need match the technological skills you’re bringing with mentorship and support.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I definitely enjoyed preparing and doing the talk which seemed to hit a lot of points for people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference overall was an amazing experience.  It was such a pleasure seeing everyone I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with and interacted with over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my coworkers that came to the conference with us had never been to a conference before. Ever.  This was amazing to me.  I&amp;rsquo;m so glad that the CfA Summit was her first one.  The warm atmosphere and the awesome community definitely gave her a great welcome and she had a blast.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Greek Financial Crisis</title>
   <link href="maksim.io/greek_crisis/"/>
   <updated>2015-07-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>maksim.io/greek_crisis</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;These are some of my favorite YouTube video producers, and they recently just made a really great explainer about the Greek crisis and how the situation got to be so bad.  For the record, I&amp;rsquo;m not pretending to be super knowledgeable about this, but I have been following it on and off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/tigaryz-1y4&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the more interesting comments he makes during the video is how for the past ten years the Greek government has been mis-reporting their financial situation.  And when a new party would take over, they would make a really big fuss about how the previous administration was lying, only to continue the cycle themselves. (Remember &amp;ndash; just going off the video &amp;ndash; I haven&amp;rsquo;t researched this too much).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth thinking a little about the role of [lack of] government transparency in this situation.  This may or not be related, and may not be the core of the problem at all, but I&amp;rsquo;m willing to posit that it was a factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it was the responsibility of the Greek Government to report all the numbers related to budgeting, debt, and deficit to the public fully and in a machine readable format, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but wonder if this situation could&amp;rsquo;ve been avoided, or at least lessened.  I&amp;rsquo;m guessing the Greek Government would continually report aggregated statistics with no way to reproduce the results.  The further you get from the raw data, the more room there is for mistakes and manipulation &amp;ndash; malicious or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I&amp;rsquo;ll also point out that government transparency is only half the game.  The other part would&amp;rsquo;ve been on citizens, reporters, watchdog groups and other EU members to take this data, analyze it &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;independently&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and provide the analysis in a reproducible format.  This way it&amp;rsquo;s not just data without the insights, but rather something actionable, credible and reproducible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just thoughts and a rant.  I read the Economist and I watch the news, but I&amp;rsquo;m no expert so don&amp;rsquo;t listen to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a much lighter note, (at least as light as the Greek financial situation can be) here&amp;rsquo;s another great video about the crisis, but this time with some rapping involved:&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Quick and Dirty PDF Table Extraction</title>
   <link href="maksim.io/pdf_extraction_tabula/"/>
   <updated>2014-10-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>maksim.io/pdf_extraction_tabula</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently, I had to do a quick, dirty and un-automated extraction of some table data from PDF.  I need to take a single table out of a financial statement and extract it to CSV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you can find plenty of tutorials on how to automate this process, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really find a whole lot on doing it just once for a specific PDF.  So I wrote a quick tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, calling this a tutorial is probably a strecth.  It&amp;rsquo;s mainly a link to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://tabula.nerdpower.org/&quot;&gt;great piece of open source software called Tabula&lt;/a&gt;  and a recommendation to use it.  They do a good job telling you how to install it on their web page, and even provide a cool &lt;a href=&quot;https://webmaker.org/tools&quot;&gt;Popcorn Maker&lt;/a&gt; on how to use it. I&amp;rsquo;m embedding it below.  Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Webhooks: A Different Pattern</title>
   <link href="maksim.io/webhooks/"/>
   <updated>2014-09-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>maksim.io/webhooks</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h3&gt;Integration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is one of the many problems of software development for governments. Many different departments may have different systems and even different use cases for interacting with your application. It is often not feasible to try to integrate with every different system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to have a consistent conversation let&amp;rsquo;s define two terms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Some Definitions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provider Application&lt;/strong&gt; - the application that is in charge of the data the developer wants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consumer Application&lt;/strong&gt; - the application that wants to integrate with the provider.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;These do not denote importance or size - there are many situations where the Consumer is much larger and more important than the Provider.  Consider a scenario where various distributed news sources (providers) are pinging on aggregator site (consumer) when new information is available.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A Scenario&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Most of this is accurate, but I might make up some facts to illustrate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s imagine that I am the developer of a shiny new platform that will help business owners find financing and education opportunities from a government.  I am aggregating various opportunities provided by various organizations (in the context of Puerto Rico, we have Economic Development Bank (BDE), Tourism, Film Commission and Company of Export and Commerce (CCE) to name a few).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When someone seeking for financing fills out some basic information, my application (provider) is going to send a lead to the appropriate department (consumer), based on the programs my user indicates she/he wants to know more about.  BDE and CCE are running two different implementations of Microsoft Dynamics CRM. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what Tourism and Film are running but I know for a fact that it&amp;rsquo;s not open source or Microsoft Dynamics.  I&amp;rsquo;m guessing something SharePoint based.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add about 15 more departments or agencies to this scenario and you see where I&amp;rsquo;m going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A non viable solution.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most obvious solution would be to develop your application (the provider) as an API server.  Each of the departments (consumers) would have to write code that runs periodically that polls your server and see if there&amp;rsquo;s any new leads related to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this is a worthwhile solution there are several problems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More work for departments (cron code, polling code is hard to write)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More work for you (either the developers in the departments or you would have to learn how to diff what&amp;rsquo;s new and what&amp;rsquo;s not.  And you want it to be you for the sake of sanity).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heavier loads on your server - imagine lots of machines polling your server every 5 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation and API changes become much more difficult because you have many people depending on the exact data structure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy in is a lot more difficult - lots more work needed and departments often just don&amp;rsquo;t have the resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A better solution - Webhooks!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if whenever a lead is submitted you can automatically notify the related department (consumer) with all the information in the lead, in real time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution is pretty simple and the level of work in building it for our application (provider) is not more than building a standard API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When departments create a new &amp;ldquo;Business Funding Opportunity&amp;rdquo; in our application, I am going to ask them for 2 extra fields:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A URL to hit when a lead is generated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A secret token to send as part of that payload.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the lead is generated, I&amp;rsquo;m going to send a standard (documented) set of data to the URL the department specified.  The payload will contain all the lead information, plus the secret token.  The developer on the department side needs only to provide me a path to hit where she/he checks for the token, and once we&amp;rsquo;re ok, she/he consumes the data I&amp;rsquo;m sending in the payload.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does she/he do with the data?  It does not matter.  She can put it in Mongo and crunch numbers on it.  She can create a lead in the CRM.  She can do that and 30 other things.  And when she/he decides thing #29 is useless, she/he can get rid of it without picking up the phone to call me &amp;ndash; since all I&amp;rsquo;m doing is sending her/him the data in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This concept is called Webhooks and they&amp;rsquo;re used all over the web.  Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Github Webhooks.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s explore Github.  They have a very sweet implementation of web hooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my repository, I can trigger a webhook to fire on certain events. If you want to follow along, go to a repo you own, then go to Settings, then Webhooks and Services.  But I&amp;rsquo;ll post Screenshots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, I currently have one webhook enabled.  This web hook will hit Slack, a messaging platform we use for communication and Slack will post various events in our chatroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mrm-screen.s3.amazonaws.com/Webhooks__Services_2014-09-02_19-28-54_2014-09-02_19-29-04.png&quot; alt=&quot;Webhook Enabled&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I manage that webhook I see a bit more info:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mrm-screen.s3.amazonaws.com/Webhook_-_httpscfa.slack.comserviceshooksgithub_2014-09-02_19-30-46_2014-09-02_19-31-11.png&quot; alt=&quot;Webhook Manage&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The payload URL I specify is given to me by Slack.  On the other end, a Slack web service just sits there and listens for the incoming data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The content type is JSON but I could pick several others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this webhook doesn&amp;rsquo;t need it, I can specify a secret token for the receiver to verify the legitimacy of the incoming data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last arrow points to something specific for Github.  I can actually pick which events trigger a webhook.  Pretty sweet deal!.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I scroll down I see a log of deliveries of the webhook:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://mrm-screen.s3.amazonaws.com/Webhook_-_httpscfa.slack.comserviceshooksgithub_2014-09-02_19-34-18_2014-09-02_19-34-24.png&quot; alt=&quot;Delivery Log&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see the URL always gets hit with the same standard set of data and the receiver knows how to process it.  In general the best practice is to send a lot of data on a webhook.  A bigger payload doesn&amp;rsquo;t hurt as much as an extra network connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The choice is yours!!!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that&amp;rsquo;s all folks.  Next time you&amp;rsquo;re looking at doing some integration, consider webhooks.  They&amp;rsquo;re not the best for every use case, but let them be another tool in your toolbox.  They&amp;rsquo;re a great asset to have and you will encourage the developers to share what they have done.  It&amp;rsquo;s a great way to build community around your product and encourage code reuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Continuous Deployment of Ghost from Github</title>
   <link href="maksim.io/ghost_continous_deployment/"/>
   <updated>2014-02-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>maksim.io/ghost_continous_deployment</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As part of my fellowship at &lt;a href=&quot;http://codeforamerica.org&quot;&gt;Code For America&lt;/a&gt;, my team had to set up a blog in order to keep everyone updated about what we&amp;rsquo;re doing and how everything is going.  Most teams just set up a tumblr blog.  However I had some ethical qualms about doing that and successfully was able to convince my team to agree to running &lt;a href=&quot;http://tryghost.org&quot;&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ghost is a very interesting blogging platform.  It came about as an answer to the bloat of WordPress into a massive CMS which is pretty resource intensive.  It&amp;rsquo;s written entirely in Node with SQLite3 database backend.  Additionally, it provides for a very nice interface in editing posts using Markdown and basically does everything you need a simple publishing platform to do for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I set it up, my team&amp;rsquo;s designer, Ainsley wanted to make some CSS changes to the blog and the theme.  She would make the changes, push them up to GitHub, but the problem was she was waiting for me to jump onto the server and pull the changes in.  On top of that, every time the codebase needs an update, the Ghost service on the machine needs to be restarted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This now meant I was a bottleneck to any development being done on the blog.  I didn&amp;rsquo;t like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started researching into how to automate this process, and found a few articles. Namely these two helped out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fideloper.com/node-github-autodeploy&quot;&gt;Fideloper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://gun.io/blog/tutorial-deploy-node-js-server-with-example/&quot;&gt;Gun.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would definitely recommend reading them.  However, my use case wasn&amp;rsquo;t as complex as these articles describe.  However, they did point me a to pretty sweet node package called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/coreh/hookshot&quot;&gt;HookShot&lt;/a&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s an extremely simple tool that allows you to listen for incoming GitHub post-receive hooks and react accordingly.  You can use it as a library, a CLI tool, or even mount it on top of your existing Express servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here are the steps&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am making assumptions here such as you&amp;rsquo;re running Ubuntu and have Upstart&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Make an upstart steps for running you ghost service.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make a file in &lt;code&gt;/etc/init/ghost-YOUR_SITE_NAME.conf&lt;/code&gt;
Add the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;# ghost-YOUR_SITE_NAME

start on startup

script
    cd /path/to/your/ghost/root
    npm start --production
end script&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will let you run the ghost process as a service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Write the listener script&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pick a port where you know nothing is running.  If you look at Ghost&amp;rsquo;s config.js file, you will see what port the ghost service is started.  You can always run &lt;code&gt;netstat --listen&lt;/code&gt; and see if the port number you chose is being used by a service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a file and add it to the code base at the root of ghost;  I called it &lt;code&gt;deploy_listener.js&lt;/code&gt;, but really the name doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter.  I&amp;rsquo;m considering renaming it to something that has to do with monkeys, because I like monkeys.  The contents of the file are pretty simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot; data-lang=&quot;js&quot;&gt;var hookshot = require(&amp;#39;hookshot&amp;#39;);
hookshot(&amp;#39;refs/heads/master&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;git fetch origin &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git checkout origin/master &amp;amp;&amp;amp; service ghost-coqui restart&amp;#39;).listen(PORT_NUMBER)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to replace the port number&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we&amp;rsquo;re going to have a process listening, but putting nginx in front of this process as well didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to make a lot of sense to me. The nginx would have to listen to either a subdomain or another port, and the next step would be necessary either way.  So I decided to bypass messing with nginx and opened up the firewall directly to the node server:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Opening up the firewall for the listener&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we need to open the IPTABLES firewall to allow requests to the port that hookshot will be running on.  This command should do it for us:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;# Need to be a priviledged user
$ sudo iptables -I INPUT 4 -p tcp --dport 9001 -j ACCEPT # (I)nserts this rule after the 4th iptables firewall rule&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Starting and running the hookshot process&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last part but not least, we need to start the hookshot process to listen for webhooks from GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just took the much easier way and installed forever to run the listener, but I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure you can just set it up as another upstart process.  In fact, you probably should since that would allow it to start running whenever your server gets rebooted. If you want to do that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make a file in &lt;code&gt;/etc/init/ghost-YOUR_SITE_NAME-listener.conf&lt;/code&gt;
Add the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;# ghost-YOUR_SITE_NAME-listener

start on startup

script
    cd /path/to/your/ghost/root
    node deploy_listener.js
end script&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other option is use forever to run the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;npm install -g forever
forever start /path/to/your/ghost/deploy_listener.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Getting github&amp;rsquo;s webhook set up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go To Settings on your GitHub repo: &lt;img src=&quot;https://monosnap.com/image/wLflXqInHVFsMsMBMMsaZoelSSeHVr.png&quot; alt=&quot;Github Settings&quot;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the left menu, select Service Hooks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under services click on Webhook URLs and add the url of your path with the port number after it. For example for our blog it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;coquicoders.org:9732&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After you save, you should have a button to test the hook &lt;img src=&quot;https://monosnap.com/image/uNqdDjBeq4jwFVedg9Chk3Dw211UGf.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot&quot;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test the hook and make sure it works.  It might help for testing if you just run &lt;code&gt;node deploy_helper.js&lt;/code&gt; before you start it up as a forever or upstart process, just so you can see it working.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Things to look into&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know how I said this is quick and dirty.  I meant it.  If you have suggestions or notes, please do let me know.  Here are the things I know I need to look into:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should I put nginx in front of the hookshot listener?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Permissions for restarting the ghost service?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think I need to use forever since I can just run the hookshot listener as a service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It may make sense to just inject hookshot directly into ghost to avoid opening up yet another port.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hardening the whole thing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Why I'm Coding For America</title>

   <updated>2014-01-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>maksim.io/why_im_coding_for_america</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am not a natural born United States citizen.  I spent the first ten years of my life in a country much different than this one, with a much different culture.  After arriving in the United States, I witnessed and participated in my family’s struggle to understand and work with the complex bureaucracies wrapped around immigration, food stamps, social security and public services.  I waited with my family in seemingly endless lines, only to be told I needed to go to a different building and wait in another endless line.  I learned that the system is flawed and wondered how to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always been curious in understanding how cities develop, sustain and function, and I have been fortunate enough to explore these topics in many cities and countries across the globe.  Just like every human being, every city&amp;ndash;while maintaining similarity in the most obvious and general features&amp;ndash;is an extremely unique and complicated living organism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just like when doctors treat human beings, often unsure that the decision or action they’re taking will help rather than harm the patient, oftentimes the people making decisions for a city simply do not have the information to be confident in the outcome of their actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always been the observer.  I always wondered, read, asked, but never acted. I saw, but never dove deep enough to understand. I often wondered how my skills could be of help, but was never really able to answer the question on my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we have the technology and the knowledge to help governments make better decisions, provide better services to their residents, and to improve the quality of numerous people’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why I’m coding for America.  As a Code For America fellow, I have an opportunity to no longer be the observer, but the doer.  I have a chance to dive in deep and use my skills to help fix and improve the systems that each of us interacts with on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess it&amp;rsquo;s weird to be writing a blog post about myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not that great at shameless self promotion.  But it was pretty cool that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.illinoistech.org&quot;&gt;Illinois Technology Association&lt;/a&gt; chose to do a spot light on me as the Solutions Architect for &lt;a href=&quot;http://prometsource.com&quot;&gt;Promet Source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;m THAT awesome, but hey, I&amp;rsquo;ll take the props.  So, thanks ITA and Promet!!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Rails 4 Strong Parameters</title>
   <link href="maksim.io/rails_4_strong_parameters/"/>
   <updated>2013-07-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>maksim.io/rails_4_strong_parameters</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ve been going through the awesome &lt;a href=&quot;http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/&quot;&gt;JumpStart Labs Tutorials&lt;/a&gt; lately to learn some rails and found a small bug in the tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not really a bug though. The tutorial was made with Rails 3.x in mind and I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Rails 4.  So I found a small discrepancy and submitted an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/JumpstartLab/curriculum/issues/606&quot;&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was strongly encouraged to blog about my journeys into Rails and Ruby so this is one of those posts.  Really hoping someone finds this useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a section in the tutorials that talks about Rails protection so you can&amp;rsquo;t just directly save parameters coming into the form in the controller.  This is a great thing so people can&amp;rsquo;t just submit bogus data or do something worse.  In the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html#i1:-form-based-workflow&quot;&gt;Form Based Workflow&lt;/a&gt; section of the tutorial, they mention adding &lt;code&gt;attr_accessible&lt;/code&gt; to be able to save the parameters coming into the form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried this and got an error saying this was deprecated in Rails 4 and has been moved off to a separate gem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a bit of googling around, I found &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubysource.com/rails-4-quick-look-strong-parameters/&quot;&gt;a great article from RubySource&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long and short of it is this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The protected parameters is a separate gem now, but is included in Rails 4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I added &lt;code&gt;config.active_record.whitelist_attributes = true&lt;/code&gt; to config/application.rb&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added &lt;code&gt;include ActiveModel::ForbiddenAttributesProtection&lt;/code&gt; to my Articles model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added the following method to my articles controller:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;def article_params
        params[:article].permit(:title, :body)
    end&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, updated my Create controller accordingly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;def create
      @article = Article.new(article_params)
      @article.save
      redirect_to article_path(@article)
    end&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Definitely learned something useful.  You can also use permit to allow certain users to edit certain fields if you wish as well.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Firm Grip on Menus in Drupal</title>
   <link href="maksim.io/firm_grip_menus_drupal/"/>
   <updated>2013-06-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>maksim.io/firm_grip_menus_drupal</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For many that have worked with Drupal in teams before, I&amp;rsquo;m sure you have run into problems with managing menus.
There are many ways to create a menu item in Drupal, one of them being from the menu editor, and others when creating content or views, or panels pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The menu items created when you&amp;rsquo;re creating content, views or panels override any configurations you may have set in the menu editor, hence the source of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the way that menu items are stored in features, they get explicitly linked to node id.  So if you have a page on dev that&amp;rsquo;s node/5 and the same page that lives on staging that&amp;rsquo;s at node/6 and prod is node/7, it&amp;rsquo;s extremely different to move menu configurations across environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was causing a ton of wasted time and even more frustration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, long story short, I needed a way to manage the menus on the site with an extremely firm grip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this great module called &lt;a href=&quot;https://drupal.org/project/menu_import&quot;&gt;Menu Import&lt;/a&gt;;  The original purpose was to be able to create IA on a drupal site by simply creating a JSON file and running a drush command.  The module will create the needed pages for you and the menu structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s look at an example menu export file: (Grabbed it from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://drupal.org/project/menu_import&quot;&gt;module page&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Pages {&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;pages/all&amp;quot;}
- Site {&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;http://external-site.com/&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;description&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Visit our site.&amp;quot;}
- Story {&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;node/3&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;description&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;A very interesting story!&amp;quot;}
- Story {&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;content/about&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;description&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;About us&amp;quot;}
-- Some node {&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;node/4&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;lang&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;da&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;description&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Links is in Danish language&amp;quot;}
Archive
- Admin zone {&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;admin/appearance&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;description&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Internal link with description.&amp;quot;}
A page {&amp;quot;description&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Description only, no link.&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;hidden&amp;quot;:true,&amp;quot;expanded&amp;quot;:true}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see - you can definitely use router paths like &lt;code&gt;node/3&lt;/code&gt; but you can also use alias paths for nodes as well like &amp;lsquo;content/about&amp;rsquo;.  This means now we don’t have to worry about the node id, only the path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Menu Import also has a nice little piece of functionality where you can export your current menu structure to a json file.  So that&amp;rsquo;s what I did -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;drush menu-export main-menu-export.txt main-menu
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then saved the file inside of the feature where I wanted my menu structure to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And subsequently, I added the following to the feature&amp;rsquo;s .module file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot; data-lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?php
function my_menu_feature_pre_features_revert($component) {
  // I actually had two menus, that&amp;#39;s why the foreach loop.
  $menu_export_files = array(
    &amp;#39;main-menu&amp;#39; =&amp;gt; &amp;#39;main-menu-export.txt&amp;#39;,
  );
  $results = array();
  if ($component == &amp;#39;menu_custom&amp;#39;) {
    if (!function_exists(&amp;#39;menu_import_file&amp;#39;)) {
      module_enable(array(&amp;#39;menu_import&amp;#39;));
    }
    $path = drupal_get_path(&amp;#39;module&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;my_menu_feature&amp;#39;);
    foreach ($menu_export_files as $menu_name =&amp;gt; $menu_export_file) {
      $result = menu_import_file($path . &amp;#39;/&amp;#39; . $menu_export_file, $menu_name, array(
        &amp;#39;link_to_content&amp;#39; =&amp;gt; TRUE,
        &amp;#39;create_content&amp;#39; =&amp;gt; FALSE,
        &amp;#39;remove_menu_items&amp;#39; =&amp;gt; TRUE,
      ));
      $results[$menu_name] = $result;
    }
    drush_print_r($results);
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the following to the .info file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot; data-lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;features[menu_custom][] = main-menu&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it! Now, when I run &lt;code&gt;drush fr -y --force commons_main_menu&lt;/code&gt;, it will force revert the feature and run the menu-import to update my menu items, deleting any previous problems before doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I need to do a &lt;code&gt;--force&lt;/code&gt; is because features may not detect any menu change configurations, so I&amp;rsquo;m forcing it to revert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is all friends. Enjoy your menu stability!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Draft Publishing In Jekyll</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a short one.
I found a great article about how achieve draft publishing in Jekyll.  Normally, you would generate a new post, and whether it&amp;rsquo;s done or not, jekyll will publish it.  However, with this you can create a bunch of stuff in the drafts folder, then move it to the publish directory, and the plugin will take it from the publish directory, append the proper date to it, and move it to posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jeffreysambells.com/2013/02/01/jekyll-draft-publishing-plugin&quot;&gt;Read On Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Creating Custom UITableViewCells with NIB files</title>
   <link href="maksim.io/Custom-UITableViewCell-With-NIB/"/>
   <updated>2012-11-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>maksim.io/Custom-UITableViewCell-With-NIB</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well this sucks.  Apparently these days you can only use the Interface Builder to design your cell in XCode if you&amp;rsquo;re using Storyboards.  But no worries. I have found a workaround which plays very nicely in iOS5+.  Let&amp;rsquo;s get to it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m assuming you already know so iOS and objective C, so I&amp;rsquo;ll save the prep for another blog post.  Let&amp;rsquo;s get down to business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have your TableViewController.h and .m files ready. Now you want to create a sleek custom cell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a new file (File -&amp;gt; New -&amp;gt; Objective C Class -&amp;gt; Subclass of UITableViewCell).  Note that the option to create a XIB for user interface is not available.  That&amp;rsquo;s fine for now.  Let&amp;rsquo;s call this class &lt;code&gt;EXCustomCell&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will get XCode to create 2 files - EXCustomCell.h and EXCustomCell.m.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the EXCustomCell.h file, right below @interface line, add&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;@property (nonatomic, strong) IBOutlet UILabel *cellItemLabel;
@property (nonatomic, strong) IBOutlet UIImageView *cellItemImageView;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the properties of the cell.  Add more to your liking!  For every one that you want to add in IB and control programmatically, you&amp;rsquo;ll need one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m assuming you&amp;rsquo;re using the latest version of XCode, so you won&amp;rsquo;t need to @synthesize.  But just in case you&amp;rsquo;re not on the latest,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;@synthesize cellItemImageView, cellItemLabel;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;right under the @implementation line at the top of the EXCustomCell.m file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, now we&amp;rsquo;ve done all the setup work, time for some IB fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to File -&amp;gt; New, in the left hand column select User Interface, and pick View.  Leave iPhone for Device Family and title the file EXCustomCell.xib&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog_post_images/custom_uitableviewcell/add_view.png&quot; alt=&quot;Select View&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click on the file to open up Interface Builder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the left hand column, under objects, click once on View and hit the delete button on your keyboard.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog_post_images/custom_uitableviewcell/remove_view.png&quot; alt=&quot;Remove View&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drag in a Table View Cell from the Object Library&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click on File&amp;rsquo;s Owner, pick the Identity Panel, and make sure that NSObject is selected as the custom class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click on the Cell you just dragged in and make sure its custom class is EXCustomCell&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drag in an ImageView and a Label.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is important.  Right click on the Custom cell under objects, pick the cellItemImageView and drag it over to the image, and repeat the same for cellItemLabel (except drag it to the label).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog_post_images/custom_uitableviewcell/drag_ibaction.png&quot; alt=&quot;Drag IBACTION&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add #import &amp;ldquo;EXCustomCell.h&amp;rdquo; to your TableViewController.m file&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now in your TableViewController.m file, at the viewDidLoad method:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;- (void)viewDidLoad
{
    [super viewDidLoad];
    [self.tableView registerNib:[UINib nibWithNibName:@&amp;quot;EXCustomCell&amp;quot;
                         bundle:[NSBundle mainBundle]]
         forCellReuseIdentifier:@&amp;quot;CustomCellReuseID&amp;quot;];
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that  &lt;code&gt;- (void) registerNib:(UINib*)nib forCellReuseIdentifier:(NSString*)identifier;&lt;/code&gt; is an iOS 5+ method.  So be careful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in cellForRowAtIndexPath:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;- (UITableViewCell *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath
{
    static NSString *CellIdentifier = @&amp;quot;CustomCellReuseID&amp;quot;;
    EXCustomCell *cell = [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:CellIdentifier];

    // Configure the cell...
    [cell.cellItemImage setImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@&amp;quot;glyphicons_428_podium&amp;quot;]];
    [cell.cellItemLabel setText = @&amp;quot;Mr Burns.&amp;quot;];
    return cell;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it!! Now you can make a custom cell use a XIB file and screw those storyboard snobs!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MrMaksimize/iOS-Dev-Boilerplates/tree/master/ExampleCustomCell&quot;&gt;Grab the code!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Zen Of Code</title>
   <link href="maksim.io/the-zen-of-code/"/>
   <updated>2012-10-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>maksim.io/the-zen-of-code</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you just need to get it out the door. Write fast, make it work, roll it out, accrue technical debt, deal with it later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But is it worth it? Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been pondering a lot about the zen that comes with good code: how it makes one feel as a developer, and what does it buy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a module that you&amp;rsquo;ve hammered out over the past three weeks. It&amp;rsquo;s a quick fix for something that needs to happen on a deadline, and you just didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to write comments, conform to coding standards, and look for functions to reuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The days are getting shorter and the problems are getting smaller, until you&amp;rsquo;re finally done! Great! You&amp;rsquo;ve made it work with a messy patchwork of if statements, for loops and undocumented functions. The deadline hits. But wait. The requirements have changed just a bit. The change is small, but because you haven&amp;rsquo;t taken the time to think about how you structured your objects, it&amp;rsquo;ll require a massive rewrite.  Bummer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You get back to drawing board and try to figure out what get_mapped_tree_nodes($id, $level, $active, &amp;amp;$tree) does.  Think about it for a while and can&amp;rsquo;t remember. Man should&amp;rsquo;ve documented this. Let&amp;rsquo;s debug. A few repeats of this later, angry and confused you finally finish and complete the requirements. Great! You&amp;rsquo;re done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Submit your pull request, get your peers to review. Approve Approve! Let&amp;rsquo;s get this in!  After the merge, you guys realize that you just crashed your production environment because bad coding standards made your reviewers miss a major bug. Try to see what caused it. Which commit was this? Was it &lt;code&gt;Add pf3 to ln42&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Add pf2 to gs43&lt;/code&gt;? Nuff said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A month later another project requires very similar functionality, but because you failed to properly abstract your functions, you can&amp;rsquo;t just pull them out or reuse them. On top of that, you don&amp;rsquo;t know what half of them do, and the datasets you used for testing before are gone. Sigh. Another 3 weeks of sleepless nights. Let&amp;rsquo;s write more code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t tell me this never happened to you. I won&amp;rsquo;t tell you it&amp;rsquo;s never happened to me. And you know what? I guarantee it&amp;rsquo;ll happen to both of us time and time again. So how do we STOP?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about this for a while, and I have come to believe there is a certain zen that comes with writing good code. Just like good deeds beget good deeds, bad code begets bad code, and good code begets good code. It&amp;rsquo;s like a windfall. You can&amp;rsquo;t start off messy and all of a sudden switch to clean and structured, and you can&amp;rsquo;t do it in reverse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well-written code takes time. It requires care, attention and love. It needs nurturing and refactoring. Worst of all, it craves extra time&amp;ndash;time that you may not have to give. But just like a child caring for their parent in their sunset years, good code will be sure to take care of you. It&amp;rsquo;ll be there when you need it for reuse on your next project, and it&amp;rsquo;ll be there when the requirements change. You can&amp;rsquo;t say that about the mumbo jumbo you just wrote to fulfill the latest requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no bullet list to follow in this post because every language has its proper structure and usage. No guidelines, no rules. But there is a mindset. Don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid to go back and refractor your functions for the better. Don&amp;rsquo;t be scared of breaking that 5000 line file into 10 smaller ones if it makes sense. And take the damn time to make your commit messages make some sense. Oh and write some docs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guarantee, when you make that pull request, or when you come back to to reuse your code on the next project, you&amp;rsquo;ll feel much happier. Much calmer. Much more complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ready? Take a deep breath. Get a beer. Get a coffee. Mix them together and chug. Now you&amp;rsquo;re in a perfect state to write good code. Give it some love!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Blog</title>
   <link href="maksim.io/the-blog/"/>
   <updated>2012-09-23T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
   <id>maksim.io/the-blog</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Oh man.  So I started a blog. Now I guess I should write stuff in it huh?  Fine. Here goes the first post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few thoughts. I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing a lot with &lt;a href=&quot;http://octopress.org/&quot;&gt;Octopress&lt;/a&gt; recently.  We just launched the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://allplayers.github.com&quot;&gt;AllPlayers Dev Blog&lt;/a&gt; built using just that.  The main idea was just to output an RSS feed for our podcasts, but we decided to write dev stuff there as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do see the appeal. I most definitely prefer the fully version controlled, markdown preview automatic Octopress.  And with a single command your site is pushed to github and live.  The templating is much better (sorry Drupal render arrays), and the built in SASS is also a win.   However, when I tried to add in a new feature, it turned out to be such a pain. I had to dig through so many different template files, mess with Mustache templating (I think that&amp;rsquo;s what they use), just to get it working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also can&amp;rsquo;t push APIs out of Octopress, consume feeds, or just mess around just for fun. It&amp;rsquo;s limiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, as I&amp;rsquo;m writing this post (in the Drupal editing interface by the way), I am truly appreciating the fact that to add the wonderful trash can image only took me a few clicks. But I don&amp;rsquo;t appreciate that I can&amp;rsquo;t preview my markdown before I save it (or hit the preview button which I never use).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, before writing this, my brain that hates writing stuff and likes writing code started churning and thinking about how I can merge static html generation of Octopress with the flexibility of Drupal.  The answer at first seems pretty clear.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.drupal.org/project/feeds&quot;&gt;Feeds&lt;/a&gt;.  So I&amp;rsquo;ve been toying with the idea of generating a feed from &lt;a href=&quot;http://mrmaksimize.github.com&quot;&gt;mrmaksimize.github.com&lt;/a&gt; and pulling it into this site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes yes, there will probably be duplicate SEO content. Damn it. But I can always get around that with a few tags.  There will also be a pain the ass of maintaining 2 websites. Well Octopress isn&amp;rsquo;t too much to maintain (compared to Drupal at least. Op gotta update a module).  Plus, if I can figure out a way to mess with github to redirect any non-feed requests back to this site, I&amp;rsquo;m in the clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing I haven&amp;rsquo;t really thought of is how to get posts written here back to Octopress.  That would be a doozy. Have to think about that one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh well, just a rant. Hope you guys like reading stuff I write.  I decided not to be anal about my writing here, and just to let it spew.&lt;/p&gt;
