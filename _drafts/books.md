What if you could not get your hands on a book?

Have you thought about it? Even if you don't always shop for books, or buy books or walk into bookstores.  Maybe you only read comics or magazines, or maybe you just really like to have coffee while you see other people reading books.  Maybe you go to a book club, or maybe you talk about what books your mom read, the books that remind you what it's like to be 5, or maybe it's the shelves of books on the walls you have in your room that you think of when you think of home. In fact the most
important and vivid thing you remember about home. That your grandparents gave up to give you a better life.
Maybe it's the
books you want to read with your loved one next to you by the lake?

Books mean so much to us. They're the essence of our being, it's something almost every culture shares.  There's no 50 arguments about 50 ways to write a book.  There's only one kind of book, made a certain way.  Maybe it's bound differently but it's still a book.  I guess scrolls and parchments count, but somehow logically they don't seem to fit in.

And what if you could never get your hands on a book and call it your own?  No Amazon, no Borders, no local bookstore that has some weird quirky books that only people in your neighborhookd could read?

That's exactly what happened in Puerto Rico.

Well, i don't know if exactly that.  But that's how it got told to me.  So let me tell it to you the way it was told to me, and then we can poke holes in my argument with facts.  This is only factful in the sense that this is how this man felt it, and he couldn't have been the only one.

"When Borders first started on the island, they gave deep discounts.  40% of Harry Potter, etc".  Obviously local retailers who had to pay much higher fees to import the books could not match those prices and stay competitive.

Essentially this was the Wal-Mart effect.  Large stores comes in, mom and pop shops close out.

It grew as time went one, but when the chain go it in trouble and shut its doors, all the local bookstores were out of business.

You could not buy a book in town.  Of course you still had amazon, but it was never the same as wealking into your favorite neighborhod bookstore, talking to the owner about a really weird book that you picked up the other day, seeing the latest issue of your favorite magazine on the shelf.

And of course you had libraries.  But it still wasn't the same.

And there's still doubt of the importance of local business?

Forget the high flying "it'll drive money back into our economy".  You probably won't feel it.  Look at the selfish reason.

If you lost that bookstore, or whatever the equivalent is, what would you do?

I thank Amy Grace Pecherskiy and my grandparents and parents for this article. I love you with all my heard.

I love my grandparents and parents with my heart and soul.  Sometimes it's difficult to deal with them, but I would not trade a single day I've had with them.  Not one.

^^ Send this to them in a card
^^ Seriously do it.
