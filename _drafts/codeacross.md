It has been such an enormous pleasure working here in Puerto Rico with amazing people that are very interested in helping their community through using their skills. There will definitely be a spearate blog post of just shout outs.

The culmination of that work is coming up this weekend at [CodeAcross Puerto Rico 2014](http://code4puertorico/codeacross).

The first part of the event on Saturday February 22 will be at Piloto 151, a coworking space in Old San Juan.  A lot of planning for the new brigade will take place as well as a lot of idea pitching and just general discussion ofj Civic Hacking;

The second part of the event will be taking place in El Capitolio where the Puerto Rican Senate and House operate.  I went to go visit it a few days ago and the place is so amazing and awe inspiring.  The room where we will be hacking is right in the center, and if you walk out of the door, you're standing right next to the Puerto Rican constitution.

I think the most exciting part about CodeAcross for me personally is the connection that is about to be made between government and regular citizens.  To bring these people together in the same room in such an important and powerful place is an amazing opportunity and I'm extremely excited about it.

Is there a better place to do civic hacking?
