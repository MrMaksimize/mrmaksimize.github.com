So I'm on the plane back from Puerto Rico.  This is one of those few precious moments in life when I choose to fully disconnect from the internet.  Well it's not really a full choice.  Could I buy Wi-Fi here? Absolutely.  But I always like to treat my plane time as protected time, time for me to get stuff done, to rest, to think.  And I prefer to keep it that way.

** The opinions expressed below are my own and are based on my own observations.  These are the impressions and feelings I got, and they're mine and no one else's **

When I first saw Puerto Rico was one of the municipalities that Code For America was going to be working with in 2014, I got extremely excited.  I knew that's where I wanted to go.  When we got the survey to select our top choices for municipalities to work with and I learned that Puerto Rico was interested in doing something with economic development, it became a no brainer for me.

I had no idea what to expect when we were flying in.  I knew that I was going to get along with the people very well, since all of my friends that I can call family are of hispanic descent.  And even though Mexican is not the same as Puerto Rican, there's a cultural similarity at the base levels that I know and love.

I also knew that I was going to have buy a suit.  People tend to dress and be a bit more conservative.  I kind of dreaded it at first, but then I remembered how good I look in a suit :)

The two former paragraphs describe the full extend of what I knew coming in.  I was going in relatively blind for the most part.  Obviously the training month at Code For America did a lot to give us the basics, but I was blanked on the specifics.

Here's what I found.

*  Some of the best hackers and innovators I've ever met working in various places in government;
*  Roots of a growing open source community
*  A student population that is interested in working with the government to make things better;
*  Some of the warmest, friendliest, kindest and intelligent people I've ever met;
*  Amazing food (probably the only part that didn't surprise me)
*  Innovators working to create coworking spaces, exchange programs, and help Puerto Rican entrepreneurs.

Puerto Rico is an incredibly interesting place for so many reasons. Its open source community is just finding its footing.  The startup and creative community is small, but it's there.  The people are sharp - they hustle and they find creative solutions and workarounds to various problems. The world that I know from Chicago and SF where there are all kinds of events and meetups every night doesn't exist. There is maybe one meetup a week for the whole city of San Juan and possibly
the whole island.  There are no douchebag 'brogrammers' and everyone is extremely down to earth.
People collaborate and hang out and talk together about their common tech interests -- there are no recruiters sneaking through the audiences handing out business cards. And even though there is drama like in every community, they support each other and they work together.  At least those are the impressions I got.

At a certain point -- the week before CodeAcross weekend, someone asked me, "Why are you working so hard to make this happen?".  Which I think is a valid question -- I was getting about 3 hours of sleep a night and consuming inexplicable amounts of caffeine.  And I was helping to organize an event -- which is far from my favorite thing to do.  The brigade organizers were doing the same thing -- but this was their event -- why would it matter to me?

Whenever I would talk to Puerto Ricans about their island, the dynamics of each conversation seemed familiar at first, but I couldn't quiet put my finger on it. Finally I realized -- it's this very subtle vibe that I've experienced before that is present in almost every conversation.  It's the same vibe that I get when I talk to my grandfather about Ukraine and my French friends about France. It's the  subtle change of tone when they mention "El Yunque", the gleam in the eye when
they talk about how I should go to the mountains over the weekend and how beautiful it is there. It's their home - they love it and want to make it better.

But they won't just tell you about it.  They'll show it to you all the good parts and all the bad parts. They'll introduce you to their friends, they'll drive with you to the forest, and they'll take you to the best cheap surfing lesson on the island that no one knows. And eventually you will fall in love with the island and love it like they do.

When I fall in love with a people and with a place like that losing sleep becomes such a trivial thing.  I've been a Code For America fellow for 2 months now.  I have been through many challenges to get here, and there are plenty more to come.  But I have received something extremely valuable after this month.

For the first time in my life I'm in a position to truly be able to make an impact in a place that I love and help the people I love.
