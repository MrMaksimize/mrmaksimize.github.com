As I was just working on an iOS app, I had a truly random thought about one of the things that makes one a good developer.  This is not a skill I have yet mastered, but it's definitely one I'm working on.

In this app, I'm using a Google service in order to get distances between two points.  So then I started thinking - well what happens when my number of requests is so high, I have to start paying Google in order to use their service?

There.  That was example 1.  I have a question, that I have no immediate need to address now in this MVP of an app.  I don't even know if anyone will download it from the app store.  But I'm starting to worry about scalability.  I think that a good developer would catch themselves and say "No, I'm not going to worry about that yet."  Not saying I catch myself every time, but I feel like I should pat myself on the back when I do.

Another example, happened as I was developing the same app.  There are some pretty cool things that I can put in using CoreData, animations, etc.  But I also want to get this thing done within the next 2 weeks, and I haven't had a bunch of time to work on it.  So I'm trying to keep the feature set to as minimal as possible.  I think this is another thing that we all should as developers do often in our code.

Finally, and this is the last one, I promise, I ran into a situation where I don't know if I'm structuring my views and view controllers in the best way possible.  But I can't seem to figure out what it is I need to look for, or what documentation to read to really understand if I'm doing the right thing.  So I made a note, and I'm planning to throw it out to some of my peers for some code review.  This is another pattern I think we try to implement as much as we can in our daily
development lives.  Why not have someone look at your code and give their 2c.  Worst case scenario, you'll end up with 2c extra knowledge.
