###Why Build an API?

Puerto Rico has a wide portfolio of perks for businesses to relocate, start or expand on the island.  A lot of these incentives are truly valuable -- they provide tax breaks to companies that bring jobs to the island and help various startups and entrepreneurs.  But finding them and even knowing they exist for businesses looking to start or relocate can be often challenging.

Through our research, it became clear to us that we needed to have a central place for storing these incentives.  On top of that, we made a fairly educated assumption that each incentive had several properties that would describe it.  Several that we determined so far:

  *  An incentive can have a type (tax credit, low interest loan, real estate rental decrease, etc).
  *  A lot of incentives are only available when you locate your business in central area, so that requires a set of geograpical properties.
  *  Various incentives are managed by different agencies
