Today, I turn 27.  It's never happened to me to be on an airplane on my birthday, and I have to say it's an interesting experience to be able to have the ability like that on one's birthday.  I've been thinking lately if at age 27, I'm happy with where I am.  So I figured I'd write about it a bit.  Yeah, it's self fulfilling banter, but if you want to read it, you deserve to know it.

### Family Life
I love my family.  I'm very happy to have them in my life and I've been extremely appreciative in how much they've supported me.  I couldn't thank them enough, even though sometimes they drive me a little crazy.  But I think that's the case for everyone, and I consider myself to be one of the luckiest people to have the kind of people in my family that I do.

I also got married to a wonderful girl in December, and that made me a part of a much bigger Irish-Catholic family as well.  In addition, that gave me a sister in law who is just under 2 years old, who is pretty awesome and possibly one of my favorite people in the world.

But just so Amy doesn't get jealous because I talk about her sister more than I do about her, I feel like I should mention that Amy one of the most wonderful, kind people that I know and I'm so very glad I married her.  She's supported me in some of my craziest ideas and has been willing to move across the country with me almost on a whim -- which is pretty badass IMO.

Finally, no discussion of my family life would be complete without mentionin the zoo that Amy and I are the maintainers off.  I'm extremely lucky to have Sadie, Willow and Kuma in my life, no matter how much they drive me nuts or how annoying they may be.  And I am forever greatful every single day that Clifton grants me his presence and wisdom.

So, with that being said, at 27, I feel pretty damn happy with my family life.

### Social
A lot of my friends are actually not developers, and are some of the most loving and amazing people I've ever met, or even heard of.  They have always been there to support me in my crazy endeavours, and I could not be more thankful for having them in my life.  There are thousands of small stories, inside jokes, drunk escapades and mischiefs that we share that are absolutely invaluable to me.

Many of them are in Chicago, but I also have wondeful and dear friends in California, Texas, Kansas, New York,  France, Sweden, Germany, Switzerland, and a lot of places all over the world.

In addition, more recently, having lived in California, I now have amazing co-fellows that I work with, as well as the people we got extremely close to in Puerto Rico who are also extremely warm and kind.

I consider myself extremely lucky to have the privilege to know these people and to love them and to have them love me back.

So as I turn 27, I feel extremely happy and lucky to know, work with, and be in touch with such amazing people.

### Professional

I have to admit, I was in a bit of a rut a few months ago.  I was starting to get to the point where I didn't really like my job even though it was very programming related.  And whether I understood it at the time or not, it was actually a very big influencer for me. I felt like I wasn't learning anything and I wasn't making a change.  I think that's the one difference.

In order for me to be professionally happy, I must continuously learning, and I must be helping people.

In terms of making money -- yeah I'm not rich and I haven't founded 10 successful companies.  And I've thought about this explicitly -- am I ok with that?  And I believe the answer is yes.  I was talking with my team mate Clara the other day, and she mentioned to me three profiles of entrepreneurs that she developed in her previous UX research.

*  The hard driving guy who wants to make tons of money and be famous and used as a reference.
*  The person for whom the definition of success is that whatever she does is helping people.

In the time I've been a fellow, I have felt extremely fulfilled, mainly because I've been able to focus on helping real people solve real problems.  A lot of times in consulting work, we focus on helping people solve perceived problems which may or may not be actually accurate.  The incentive / desire / skill oftentimes is just not there to really understand what the real problems are and how to solve them in the best way.

So as of today, I'm in a position where I'm constantly learning and innovating, and I'm helping people at the same time.  So as I turn 27 -- I'm extremely happy being where I am and not being a filthy rich guy.

### Life Experience overall.

I have traveled in many places around the world.  I have met amazing people and have had good and bad experiences.  I have worked with a government in Puerto Rico (still working with them, so it's pretty recent -- but still).  I have organized a hackathon in the Capitol of Puerto Rico.  I have built websites used by hundreds, thousands, and no one.  I married an amazing woman and have a great family.  I have people who I love and who love me.

So I think I can really say -- as I turn 27, I'm very happy to be where I am.  That's not to say that I should stop moving forward and that's not to say I have no problems.  And that's definitely not to say I have no challenges in front of me to overcome.

But as I look today, I'm exactly where I want to be and I'm extremely happy about it.
