So, it's my birthday and I'm on my way back to Chicago.  The plan is to fly back to Chicago, pick up my wife Amy and my zoo, and then head back driving to our new place in Oakland.

I"m extremely excited to come back and see my wife and my friends in Chicago.  I have grown up with these people and love them dearly, and I'm extremely excited to party with them for St. Patrick's day and see them in general.  I'm also excited to see my family and just be home for a few days in general.

But before I left, I got an amazing surprise from my Coqui Ladies, Clara and Ainsley.  I was in the office this morning before I left just to grab some stuff and hang out before I got on the plane.  I went to the bathroom (as I often do), only to come out to an awesome poster of myself depicted as a Coqui, with the words "Happy Birthday Coqui Max".

This was accompanied by an birthday song and Raspberry cake with a candle in it.  In addition, there was a card with an extremely accurate depiction of me as a Coqui -- tattoos, piercings, facial hair -- everything!

And just when I thought that was it, I got another surprise.  This video from our wonderful friends in Puerto Rico:

In the words of Imanol, the brigade captain, "You can say there were two people from the Puerto Rican Government, two brigade captains, a software evangelist, the president of ACM student Chapter and The Co-Founder of #include girls in the bathroom, shooting a video inside."
**For clarification purposes, the reason they were in the bathroom was because it was one of the few places in the building with no echo **

So I wanted to thank Imanol, Stephanie, Alberto, Andres, Amerigo, Benito, and Xiomana for the wonderful birthday greeting, and of course to Clara and Ainsley for organizing the whole thing.

Thank you for making my birthday feel awesome and special. I'm really lucky to be working with such wonderful people on my team as well as in Puerto Rico.

Thank you Coqui Ladies!
