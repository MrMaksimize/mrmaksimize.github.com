##Hello There, I’m Maksim Pecherskiy!

I’m a web and mobile developer and architect with B.S. in Information Systems from DePaul University and a B.S. in International Business from Linkoping University.

I'm an avid traveler and enjoy learning and interacting with new cultures, meeting new people, and arguing viewpoints that differ from mine. I adapt quickly to new cultures and always seek to push my comfort limits. I speak Russian, English, a decent amount of Spanish and just a little bit of French (I really mean very little).

I have been "officially" been a developer for the past five years, and "unofficially" for the past 15.

Since I figured out that minesweeper was not the coolest thing you can do on a computer at the age of 12, here are some of the things I have done:
  *  Got yelled at by Comcast for eating up too much bandwith for running a web / IRC / FTP server out of my room (2000ish - 8th grade).
  *  Fell in love with Linux after installing Gentoo before before it had a pretty UI. (9th grade)
  *  Built several high performance gaming machines for competitions. (High School)
  *  Wrote a thesis on long term investment strategies
  *  Deployed several high traffic and marketing projects for PG and Wal-Mart, with compatibility across feature phones, smart phones, and super phones.
  *  Built an API for AllPlayers, helped build the docs, and launched an iOS App on top of it.
  *  Ran a team to deploy 12 sites. From two codebases.  With Single Sign On. And capability to spawn more.
  *  Worked with the government / CIO of Puerto Rico to help solve economic development issues.

I did not learn Computer Science in college. I'm a self taught developer and I value that. I am constantly learning and playing with new languages.  My recent weapon of choice has been Node and Javascript, but I have worked with PHP and Drupal, Ruby and Chef, Objective C,  Mongo, Postgres and many other tools that I have chosen to learn either for a project or just for fun.

I enjoy writing beautiful code, and designing build systems for smooth CI.  And I truly enjoy learning new things.
