I should just put this up here.  This is not technical.  It's just an exploration in words of my current mindset and what's been going through my head.  It might be too long to read and too scattered.  If you're not into that kind of post, move in, I won't be upset about it.

I never buy wifi on airplanes.  I don't think I've done it once in my life.  I believe that those few hours that you're in the air -- you're away from the world.  It's your chance to disconnect from the rest of the world and focus on your thoughts.

To be fair, disconnection is different for different people at different times.  In my particular case, when I'm on the airplane, my level of disconnection tends to involve some good music, and my laptop open.

Clearly as I write this, I'm on plane back to San Francisco from Puerto Rico, but how does it relate? Well bear with me.

The capability to disconnect is just as important to our every day lives as the ability to stay connected.  I would even wager it as more important.  However, we tend to greatly undervalue it.  And when we do finally disconnect -- in situations such as this plane ride -- we always find ways to hook back in.  Whether it's paying $10 for a Wi-Fi connection, swiping a credit card to make a phone call, or even just making sure the laptop battery is charged up -- we have gotten more and more creative and capable of staying connected;
