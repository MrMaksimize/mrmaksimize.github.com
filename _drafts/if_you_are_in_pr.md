I want to write this post just to give a different side to the same argument.  The goal of this is to open your eyes to a different perspective -- you don't have to agree with me on everything here.  In fact, if you do, you probably didn't read this right.

If you are you a programmer / designer / entrepreneur / creative professional living in Puerto Rico today, life is definitely challenging. The crime rate is fairly high.  Starting a business is a complicated process and failing is expensive.  If you work with open source, it's probably difficult to find a job.  There is a very small community for you to be a part of.

But I would say there is a different way to look at this.  Keep in mind -- this is an outsider's perspective who has only been in Puerto Rico for a month.  So please do take it with a grain of salt.

I see Puerto Rico differently.  I see opportunity in Puerto Rico differently.

If you go to San Francisco or Chicago to do a startup:

*  You are one in 1000s of companies working on a startup and vying for investor money. How do you get noticed?
*  You are entering a heavily saturated market if you plan to launch most places in the US.
*  You will have accelerators and incubators -- but the competition to get in is going to be much higher -- because there are more competitors.
*  You will have more networking and professional development opportunities.


If you launch in Puerto Rico:

*  It's hard to go through the logistics of starting a business. (Hopefully it will change soon).
*  The Puerto Rican market is nowhere near as saturated as the rest of the US (depends for what things of course)
*  You have easy access to the Caribbean markets and South and Central America. On top of that, Puerto Ricans share a lot of similarities with those markets -- and catering to them will probably be easier.
*  If you choose to cater to those markets, it's extremely easy to find bilingual employees.
*  Puerto Rico is extremely culturally diverse by area -- if you want to do market testing your shipping distances are 20 - 30 miles, not 200 - 300.
*  If you do choose to operate in South / Central America, then by the time you're operating in 10 countries, your US competitors are operating in 10 states.  Who do you think has better information on their consumers?
*  Oh and did I mention that rent to get a place is a lot cheaper than most large cities in the mainland?
*  Free publicity - there is such a small amount of activity in Puerto Rico, you would get massive press just for existing.  For free.


Just some thoughts.  I know there are people that will say I'm wrong here.  I want you to tell me.  Please post in the comments.
