I love to create. To build. To see things grow and mature. I like figuring out new things and new languages and there's nothing more satisfying than having a creation come to life. I thrive on complexity and challenges, and being bored is by far my biggest fear. 

This is the reason I'm a web developer. An open source web developer. A [Drupal](http://drupal.org) developer. I work with a framework that has been loved and worked on for years by people just like myself and has helped thousands of people build amazing things. 

In and out of the Drupal world I share as much as I can, and participate as much as I can. I firmly believe that open source software is one of the strongest testaments to humanity's ingenuity and good-heartedness. 

I'm always learning new things in the areas that I know and more importantly things I don't know.

I'm an avid traveler and enjoy learning and interacting with new cultures, meeting new people, and arguing viewpoints that differ from mine. I adapt quickly to new cultures and always seek to push my comfort limits. I speak Russian, English, a decent amount of Spanish and just a little bit of French (I really mean very little). 

I also love animals. I have 2 cats (I know some people think it's crazy, but they're really cool cats) and have a dog named Willow.
