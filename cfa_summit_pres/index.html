We went through an overview of the process of my getting hired at the city of San Diego, which was an interesting process indeed.</p><p>You can catch the video here:</p><iframe width=560 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/6BGw2Msv2Wg frameborder=0 allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Some of the key points we tried to hit:</p><h3>Go to the Candidate</h3><p>The candidates government are often looking for tend to not go trolling around for jobs on government websites. Find them where they already hang out &ndash; StackOverflow, Meetup Groups, Mailing lists.</p><h3>Involve the Private Sector</h3><p>Private sector participation lends credibility to our process, ensures community buy-in, and helps governments evaluate a candidate’s compatibility in both the public and the private sector.</p><h3>Communicate the Challenge</h3><p>Working in a startup with a 100 people is very different than working in an organization of 11,000. Being responsible to a few shareholders is very different than having to answer to a few million taxpayers. Cities need to be better at communicating the challenge inherent in this type of scale to applicants. Taking on these types of challenges is a once in a lifetime opportunity.</p><h3>Be Agile</h3><p>For government to be competitive in attracting technologists it must be innovative, flexible, and make decisions quickly.</p><h3>Show Humanity</h3><p>When I found out I was going to interview with the Mayor, wasn’t sure whether I should take off the piercings. A thought process involving a wise Russian, a loud Argentinian and several Coronas, I decided that I needed to get hired as myself.</p><p>As I walked into the Mayor’s conference room we all sat down. He asked me if I wanted a cup of coffee. Like an idiot I said yes, so the Mayor got up and made me a cup of coffee.</p><p>During the interview a question prompted me to open my laptop, and I did, not giving a thought to the plethora of stickers I had on the lid, including a middle finger sticker. So my laptop proceeds to flip off the Mayor.</p><p>A culture where the Mayor gives the go ahead to hire the pierced guy whose laptop flipped him off ripples through all ranks of the organization. If cities have a culture anywhere near as awesome as the City of San Diego does today, they should put that front and center in the hiring process.</p><h3>Support and Mentoring</h3><p>Governments need match the technological skills you’re bringing with mentorship and support.</p><p>Overall, I definitely enjoyed preparing and doing the talk which seemed to hit a lot of points for people.</p><p>The conference overall was an amazing experience. It was such a pleasure seeing everyone I&rsquo;ve worked with and interacted with over the years.</p><p>One of my coworkers that came to the conference with us had never been to a conference before. Ever. This was amazing to me. I&rsquo;m so glad that the CfA Summit was her first one. The warm atmosphere and the awesome community definitely gave her a great welcome and she had a blast.</p></div><div class=related><h2>Related Posts</h2><ul class=related-posts><li><h3><a href="/what-i-learned-one-year-cdo/">What I Learned In One Year as CDO of San Diego <small>11 Jan 2016</small></a></h3></li><li><h3><a href="/webhooks/">Webhooks: A Different Pattern <small>03 Sep 2014</small></a></h3></li><li><h3><a href="/ghost_continous_deployment/">Continuous Deployment of Ghost from Github <small>08 Feb 2014</small></a></h3></li></ul></div><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=text/javascript>/* * * CONFIGURATION VARIABLES: EDIT BEFORE PASTING INTO YOUR WEBPAGE * * */
