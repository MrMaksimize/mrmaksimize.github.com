Write fast, make it work, roll it out, accrue technical debt, deal with it later.</p><p>But is it worth it? Lately I&rsquo;ve been pondering a lot about the zen that comes with good code: how it makes one feel as a developer, and what does it buy?</p><p>Take a module that you&rsquo;ve hammered out over the past three weeks. It&rsquo;s a quick fix for something that needs to happen on a deadline, and you just didn&rsquo;t have time to write comments, conform to coding standards, and look for functions to reuse.</p><p>The days are getting shorter and the problems are getting smaller, until you&rsquo;re finally done! Great! You&rsquo;ve made it work with a messy patchwork of if statements, for loops and undocumented functions. The deadline hits. But wait. The requirements have changed just a bit. The change is small, but because you haven&rsquo;t taken the time to think about how you structured your objects, it&rsquo;ll require a massive rewrite. Bummer.</p><p>You get back to drawing board and try to figure out what get_mapped_tree_nodes($id, $level, $active, &amp;$tree) does. Think about it for a while and can&rsquo;t remember. Man should&rsquo;ve documented this. Let&rsquo;s debug. A few repeats of this later, angry and confused you finally finish and complete the requirements. Great! You&rsquo;re done!</p><p>Submit your pull request, get your peers to review. Approve Approve! Let&rsquo;s get this in! After the merge, you guys realize that you just crashed your production environment because bad coding standards made your reviewers miss a major bug. Try to see what caused it. Which commit was this? Was it <code>Add pf3 to ln42</code> or <code>Add pf2 to gs43</code>? Nuff said.</p><a href="/the-zen-of-code/">Read more &raquo;</a></div><div class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href="/the-blog/">The Blog</a></h1><span class=post-date>23 Sep 2012</span><p>Oh man. So I started a blog. Now I guess I should write stuff in it huh? Fine. Here goes the first post.</p><p>A few thoughts. I&rsquo;ve been playing a lot with <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> recently. We just launched the new <a href=http://allplayers.github.com>AllPlayers Dev Blog</a> built using just that. The main idea was just to output an RSS feed for our podcasts, but we decided to write dev stuff there as well.</p><p>I do see the appeal. I most definitely prefer the fully version controlled, markdown preview automatic Octopress. And with a single command your site is pushed to github and live. The templating is much better (sorry Drupal render arrays), and the built in SASS is also a win. However, when I tried to add in a new feature, it turned out to be such a pain. I had to dig through so many different template files, mess with Mustache templating (I think that&rsquo;s what they use), just to get it working.</p><p>I also can&rsquo;t push APIs out of Octopress, consume feeds, or just mess around just for fun. It&rsquo;s limiting.</p><p>On the other hand, as I&rsquo;m writing this post (in the Drupal editing interface by the way), I am truly appreciating the fact that to add the wonderful trash can image only took me a few clicks. But I don&rsquo;t appreciate that I can&rsquo;t preview my markdown before I save it (or hit the preview button which I never use).</p><a href="/the-blog/">Read more &raquo;</a></div></div><div class=pagination><span class="pagination-item older">Older</span> <a class="pagination-item newer" href=/page2>Newer</a></div></div></div><label for=sidebar-checkbox class=sidebar-toggle></label></body></html>
