I guess it's weird to be writing a blog post about myself.

I'm not that great at shameless self promotion.  But it was pretty cool that the [Illinois Technology Association](http://www.illinoistech.org) chose to do a spot light on me as the Solutions Architect for [Promet Source](http://prometsource.com).

I personally don't think I'm THAT awesome, but hey, I'll take the props.  So, thanks ITA and Promet!!
