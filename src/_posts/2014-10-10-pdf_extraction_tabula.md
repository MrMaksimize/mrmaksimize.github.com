title: "Quick and Dirty PDF Table Extraction"
category: data
---

Recently, I had to do a quick, dirty and un-automated extraction of some table data from PDF.  I need to take a single table out of a financial statement and extract it to CSV.

While you can find plenty of tutorials on how to automate this process, I didn't really find a whole lot on doing it just once for a specific PDF.  So I wrote a quick tutorial.

Actually, calling this a tutorial is probably a strecth.  It's mainly a link to a [great piece of open source software called Tabula](http://tabula.nerdpower.org/)  and a recommendation to use it.  They do a good job telling you how to install it on their web page, and even provide a cool [Popcorn Maker](https://webmaker.org/tools) on how to use it. I'm embedding it below.  Enjoy!
