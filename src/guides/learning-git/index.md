<div class="message">
    I designed this page to be an updated resource for people that want to learn git.
</div>

## If you do NOTHING else:
* [Try Github](http://try.github.com)
* Make a GitHub Account
* [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
* [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

## For those that know, and just want a cheatsheet:
* [Tower's Git Cheat Sheet](http://www.git-tower.com/blog/git-cheat-sheet/)
* [Github's Git Cheat Sheet](https://training.github.com/kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf)



## But if you REALLY want to learn:
The first thing you need to do when learning git is to go through the excellent [Try Github](http://try.github.com) tutorial that  GitHub and CodeSchool developed.  You will also want to make a [GitHub](http://github.com) account.  GitHub is NOT git, but it's a way for you to collaborate with others on various projects.

That should give you a good base.  Next, I'd recommend reading the [Git Parable](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2009/05/19/the-git-parable.html). This is a written story that relates how git works to real life.  Useful for understanding how git works.

To continue on your journey, I will point you to [GitHub](http://github.com). I mentioned this earlier, but if you haven't listened to me, please go ahead and make an account:

Github has a [great guides section](https://guides.github.com/).  You can review them all, but I will recommend some for you, in order of how (I believe) you should take them:

* [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
* [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
* [Getting Your Project on Github](https://guides.github.com/introduction/getting-your-project-on-github/)
* [Mastering Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)


Now, that "Mastering Markdown" one, I actually end up sharing a lot.  That's because Markdown isn't just used on GitHub, but it's used a ton of places on the internet.  The reason why Markdown is great is a whole different blog post, but I suggest going through that one for sure.


Happy Learning! Remember -- git is a tool that will help you be awesome not just when writing code, but when writing prose as well!  This blog runs on GitHub!
