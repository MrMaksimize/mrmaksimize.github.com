##Hello There, Iâ€™m Maksim Pecherskiy!

I'm a software developer who is passionate about government and technology.

I hold a B.S. in Information Systems from DePaul University and a B.S. in International Business from Linkoping University.

I'm an avid traveler and enjoy learning and interacting with new cultures, meeting new people, and arguing viewpoints that differ from mine. I adapt quickly to new cultures and always seek to push my comfort limits. I speak Russian, English, a decent amount of Spanish and just a little bit of French (I really mean very little).

I also love animals. And so does my wonderful wife Amy.

We have one one cool cat (Clifton), one fat cat (Kuma - aptly named after a burger joint), one crazy dog (Willow) and one chill dog (Sadie).

I use this blog to share my experiences and my knowledge with the world.
