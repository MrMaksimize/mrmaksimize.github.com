This is a short one.
I found a great article about how achieve draft publishing in Jekyll.  Normally, you would generate a new post, and whether it's done or not, jekyll will publish it.  However, with this you can create a bunch of stuff in the drafts folder, then move it to the publish directory, and the plugin will take it from the publish directory, append the proper date to it, and move it to posts.
