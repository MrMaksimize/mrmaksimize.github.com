The tutorial was made with Rails 3.x in mind and I&rsquo;ve been using Rails 4. So I found a small discrepancy and submitted an <a href=https://github.com/JumpstartLab/curriculum/issues/606>issue</a></p><p>I was strongly encouraged to blog about my journeys into Rails and Ruby so this is one of those posts. Really hoping someone finds this useful.</p><a href="/rails_4_strong_parameters/">Read more &raquo;</a></div><div class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href="/firm_grip_menus_drupal/">Firm Grip on Menus in Drupal</a></h1><span class=post-date>05 Jun 2013</span><p>For many that have worked with Drupal in teams before, I&rsquo;m sure you have run into problems with managing menus. There are many ways to create a menu item in Drupal, one of them being from the menu editor, and others when creating content or views, or panels pages.</p><p>The menu items created when you&rsquo;re creating content, views or panels override any configurations you may have set in the menu editor, hence the source of the problem.</p><p>In addition, the way that menu items are stored in features, they get explicitly linked to node id. So if you have a page on dev that&rsquo;s node/5 and the same page that lives on staging that&rsquo;s at node/6 and prod is node/7, it&rsquo;s extremely different to move menu configurations across environments.</p><p>This was causing a ton of wasted time and even more frustration.</p><a href="/firm_grip_menus_drupal/">Read more &raquo;</a></div><div class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href="/draft-workflow-in-jekyll/">Draft Publishing In Jekyll</a></h1><span class=post-date>28 Apr 2013</span><p>This is a short one. I found a great article about how achieve draft publishing in Jekyll. Normally, you would generate a new post, and whether it&rsquo;s done or not, jekyll will publish it. However, with this you can create a bunch of stuff in the drafts folder, then move it to the publish directory, and the plugin will take it from the publish directory, append the proper date to it, and move it to posts.</p><p><a href=http://jeffreysambells.com/2013/02/01/jekyll-draft-publishing-plugin>Read On Here</a></p><a href="/draft-workflow-in-jekyll/">Read more &raquo;</a></div><div class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href="/Custom-UITableViewCell-With-NIB/">Creating Custom UITableViewCells with NIB files</a></h1><span class=post-date>13 Nov 2012</span><p>Well this sucks. Apparently these days you can only use the Interface Builder to design your cell in XCode if you&rsquo;re using Storyboards. But no worries. I have found a workaround which plays very nicely in iOS5+. Let&rsquo;s get to it!</p><p>I&rsquo;m assuming you already know so iOS and objective C, so I&rsquo;ll save the prep for another blog post.

Write fast, make it work, roll it out, accrue technical debt, deal with it later.</p><p>But is it worth it? Lately I&rsquo;ve been pondering a lot about the zen that comes with good code: how it makes one feel as a developer, and what does it buy?</p><p>Take a module that you&rsquo;ve hammered out over the past three weeks. It&rsquo;s a quick fix for something that needs to happen on a deadline, and you just didn&rsquo;t have time to write comments, conform to coding standards, and look for functions to reuse.</p><p>The days are getting shorter and the problems are getting smaller, until you&rsquo;re finally done! Great! You&rsquo;ve made it work with a messy patchwork of if statements, for loops and undocumented functions. The deadline hits. But wait. The requirements have changed just a bit. The change is small, but because you haven&rsquo;t taken the time to think about how you structured your objects, it&rsquo;ll require a massive rewrite. Bummer.</p><p>You get back to drawing board and try to figure out what get_mapped_tree_nodes($id, $level, $active, &amp;$tree) does. Think about it for a while and can&rsquo;t remember. Man should&rsquo;ve documented this. Let&rsquo;s debug. A few repeats of this later, angry and confused you finally finish and complete the requirements. Great! You&rsquo;re done!</p><p>Submit your pull request, get your peers to review. Approve Approve! Let&rsquo;s get this in! After the merge, you guys realize that you just crashed your production environment because bad coding standards made your reviewers miss a major bug. Try to see what caused it. Which commit was this? Was it <code>Add pf3 to ln42</code> or <code>Add pf2 to gs43</code>? Nuff said.</p><a href="/the-zen-of-code/">Read more &raquo;</a></div></div><div class=pagination><a class="pagination-item older" href=/page3>Older</a> <a class="pagination-item newer" href="/">Newer</a></div></div></div><label for=sidebar-checkbox class=sidebar-toggle></label></body></html>
