I spent the first ten years of my life in a country much different than this one, with a much different culture. After arriving in the United States, I witnessed and participated in my family’s struggle to understand and work with the complex bureaucracies wrapped around immigration, food stamps, social security and public services. I waited with my family in seemingly endless lines, only to be told I needed to go to a different building and wait in another endless line. I learned that the system is flawed and wondered how to fix it.</p><p>I have always been curious in understanding how cities develop, sustain and function, and I have been fortunate enough to explore these topics in many cities and countries across the globe. Just like every human being, every city&ndash;while maintaining similarity in the most obvious and general features&ndash;is an extremely unique and complicated living organism.</p><p>And just like when doctors treat human beings, often unsure that the decision or action they’re taking will help rather than harm the patient, oftentimes the people making decisions for a city simply do not have the information to be confident in the outcome of their actions.</p><p>I have always been the observer. I always wondered, read, asked, but never acted. I saw, but never dove deep enough to understand. I often wondered how my skills could be of help, but was never really able to answer the question on my own.</p><p>Today we have the technology and the knowledge to help governments make better decisions, provide better services to their residents, and to improve the quality of numerous people’s lives.</p><p>That’s why I’m coding for America. As a Code For America fellow, I have an opportunity to no longer be the observer, but the doer. I have a chance to dive in deep and use my skills to help fix and improve the systems that each of us interacts with on a daily basis.</p><a href="/why_im_coding_for_america/">Read more &raquo;</a></div><div class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href="/ita_spotlight/">ITA Spotlight -- ME!</a></h1><span class=post-date>16 Oct 2013</span><p>I guess it&rsquo;s weird to be writing a blog post about myself.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not that great at shameless self promotion.

The tutorial was made with Rails 3.x in mind and I&rsquo;ve been using Rails 4. So I found a small discrepancy and submitted an <a href=https://github.com/JumpstartLab/curriculum/issues/606>issue</a></p><p>I was strongly encouraged to blog about my journeys into Rails and Ruby so this is one of those posts. Really hoping someone finds this useful.</p><a href="/rails_4_strong_parameters/">Read more &raquo;</a></div><div class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href="/firm_grip_menus_drupal/">Firm Grip on Menus in Drupal</a></h1><span class=post-date>05 Jun 2013</span><p>For many that have worked with Drupal in teams before, I&rsquo;m sure you have run into problems with managing menus. There are many ways to create a menu item in Drupal, one of them being from the menu editor, and others when creating content or views, or panels pages.</p><p>The menu items created when you&rsquo;re creating content, views or panels override any configurations you may have set in the menu editor, hence the source of the problem.</p><p>In addition, the way that menu items are stored in features, they get explicitly linked to node id. So if you have a page on dev that&rsquo;s node/5 and the same page that lives on staging that&rsquo;s at node/6 and prod is node/7, it&rsquo;s extremely different to move menu configurations across environments.</p><p>This was causing a ton of wasted time and even more frustration.</p><a href="/firm_grip_menus_drupal/">Read more &raquo;</a></div><div class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href="/draft-workflow-in-jekyll/">Draft Publishing In Jekyll</a></h1><span class=post-date>28 Apr 2013</span><p>This is a short one. I found a great article about how achieve draft publishing in Jekyll. Normally, you would generate a new post, and whether it&rsquo;s done or not, jekyll will publish it. However, with this you can create a bunch of stuff in the drafts folder, then move it to the publish directory, and the plugin will take it from the publish directory, append the proper date to it, and move it to posts.</p><p><a href=http://jeffreysambells.com/2013/02/01/jekyll-draft-publishing-plugin>Read On Here</a></p><a href="/draft-workflow-in-jekyll/">Read more &raquo;</a></div></div><div class=pagination><a class="pagination-item older" href=/page3>Older</a> <a class="pagination-item newer" href="/">Newer</a></div></div></div><label for=sidebar-checkbox class=sidebar-toggle></label></body></html>
