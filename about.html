In the first six months, he worked with coordinators from 35 departments to successfully complete the City’s first data inventory — an index of over 2000 datasets. He also began to build guidelines for how the city will manage and release its data and helped to host and plan the National Day of Civic Hacking in San Diego.</p><p>He has been solving complex problems with technology for nearly a decade. He spent 2014 working as a Code For America fellow in Puerto Rico with a focus on economic development. His team delivered a product called PrimerPeso that provides business owners and residents a tool to search, and apply for, government programs for which they may be eligible.</p><p>Before moving to California, Maksim was a Solutions Architect at Promet Source in Chicago where he built large web applications and designed complex integrations. He shaped workflow, configuration management and continuous integration processes, while leading and training international development teams. Before his work at Promet, he was a software engineer at AllPlayers, who was instrumental in the design and architecture of the company’s APIs as well as development and documentation of supporting client libraries in various languages.</p><p>Maksim graduated from DePaul University with a bachelor of science degree in information systems and from Linköping University, Sweden, with a bachelor of science degree in international business. He is also certified as a Lean Six Sigma Green Belt.</p><p>Maksim is an avid traveler and enjoys learning and interacting with new cultures, meeting new people, and arguing viewpoints that differ from his. He is fluent in Russian, English, and can sometimes speak Spanish.</p><p>He also loves animals and his beautiful wife Amy. They have 2 cats and 2 dogs, effectively barring any of their allergic friends from entering their apartment.</p></div></div></div><label for=sidebar-checkbox class=sidebar-toggle></label></body></html>
