I spent the first ten years of my life in a country much different than this one, with a much different culture. After arriving in the United States, I witnessed and participated in my family’s struggle to understand and work with the complex bureaucracies wrapped around immigration, food stamps, social security and public services. I waited with my family in seemingly endless lines, only to be told I needed to go to a different building and wait in another endless line. I learned that the system is flawed and wondered how to fix it.</p><p>I have always been curious in understanding how cities develop, sustain and function, and I have been fortunate enough to explore these topics in many cities and countries across the globe. Just like every human being, every city&ndash;while maintaining similarity in the most obvious and general features&ndash;is an extremely unique and complicated living organism.</p><p>And just like when doctors treat human beings, often unsure that the decision or action they’re taking will help rather than harm the patient, oftentimes the people making decisions for a city simply do not have the information to be confident in the outcome of their actions.</p><p>I have always been the observer. I always wondered, read, asked, but never acted. I saw, but never dove deep enough to understand. I often wondered how my skills could be of help, but was never really able to answer the question on my own.</p><p>Today we have the technology and the knowledge to help governments make better decisions, provide better services to their residents, and to improve the quality of numerous people’s lives.</p><p>That’s why I’m coding for America. As a Code For America fellow, I have an opportunity to no longer be the observer, but the doer. I have a chance to dive in deep and use my skills to help fix and improve the systems that each of us interacts with on a daily basis.</p></div><div class=related><h2>Related Posts</h2><ul class=related-posts><li><h3><a href="/code%20integrations/webhooks/">Webhooks: A Different Pattern <small>03 Sep 2014</small></a></h3></li><li><h3><a href="/code/ghost_continous_deployment/">Continuous Deployment of Ghost from Github <small>08 Feb 2014</small></a></h3></li><li><h3><a href="/meta/thoughts/the-zen-of-code/">The Zen Of Code <small>23 Oct 2012</small></a></h3></li></ul></div></div></div><label for=sidebar-checkbox class=sidebar-toggle></label></body></html>
